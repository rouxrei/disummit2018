 TANZANIA HIV IMPACT SURVEY
 (THIS)
 2016-2017

                                                                                 The Tanzania HIV Impact Survey (THIS), a household-
                                                                                 based national survey, was conducted between
                                                                                 October 2016 and August 2017 to measure the status
                                                                                 of Tanzania's national HIV response. THIS offered
HIV counseling and testing with return of results, and collected information about household and individual
characteristics, and uptake of HIV care and treatment services. THIS survey was the first in Tanzania to measure
national HIV incidence and viral load suppression. The results provide information on national and sub-national
progress toward control of the HIV epidemic.

THIS was led by the Government of Tanzania under the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender,
Elderly and Children (MoHCDGEC) and the Ministry of Health (MoH) Zanzibar through the National Bureau of
Statistics (NBS) and the Office of Chief Government Statistician (OCGS). The THIS was conducted with funding
from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and technical assistance through the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ICAP at Columbia University.

The survey was implemented by NBS, OCGS, and ICAP in collaboration with local partners, including the Tanzania
Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS), the Zanzibar AIDS Commission (ZAC), the National Health Laboratory - Quality
Assurance and Training Center (NHL-QATC), the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), and the Zanzibar
Integrated HIV, Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program (ZIHTLP).

duration of recent infection (MDRI) of 130 days;
* male and female specific prevalence estimates for Zanzibar, and male 0-14 year old VLS not shown due to insufficient sample size to obtain a meaningful
 estimate for subcategory.

Annual incidence of HIV among adults ages 15 to 64 years in Tanzania is 0.29 percent (0.40 percent among females
and 0.17 percent among males). This corresponds to approximately 81,000 new cases of HIV annually among adults
ages 15 to 64 years in Tanzania.

Prevalence of HIV among adults ages 15 to 64 years in Tanzania is 5.0 percent (6.5 percent among females and 3.5 percent
among males). This corresponds to approximately 1.4 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) ages 15 to 64 years in Tanzania.

Prevalence of viral load suppression (VLS) among HIV-positive adults ages 15 to 64 years in Tanzania is 52.0 percent
(57.5 percent among females and 41.2 percent among males).

HIV PREVALENCE, BY AGE AND SEX

HIV prevalence peaks at 12 percent
among females aged 45 to 49, as
compared to a peak of 8.4 percent
among males aged 40 to 44.
Prevalence among 15 to 24 years old is
1.4 percent (2.1 percent among females
and 0.6 percent among males). The
disparity in HIV prevalence between
males and females is most pronounced
among younger adults, with women
in age groups 15 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 to
29, 30 to 34 and 35 to 39 all having
prevalence more than double that of
males in the same age groups.

VIRAL LOAD SUPPRESSION AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV, BY AGE

Viral load suppression among HIV positive
individuals in Tanzania is highest among older
adults, with 64.4 percent of females ages 55
to 64 virally suppressed, and 61.5 percent
of males ages 55 to 64 virally suppressed.
Gender disparity in viral load suppression
is greater among younger adults, with 50.5
percent of females ages 25 to 34 virally
suppressed and 25.7 percent of men in the
same age group virally suppressed.

90­90­90: an ambitious treatment target to help end the AIDS epidemic
By 2020, 90 percent of all PLHIV will know their HIV status; 90 percent of all people with diagnosed HIV infection will receive
sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART); and 90 percent of all people receiving ART will have viral suppression.

Diagnosed                                                                On Treatment
In Tanzania, 52.2 percent of PLHIV ages 15 to 64 years (55.9             Among PLHIV ages 15 to 64 years who know their HIV status,
percent of HIV-positive females and 45.3 percent of HIV-                 90.9 percent (92.9 percent of HIV-positive females and 86.1

PREVALENCE OF HEPATITIS B, BY SEX, AGE, AND HIV STATUS

THIS also tested a subset of participants for hepatitis to get a national estimate of chronic active hepatitis B prevalence.
Among adults ages 15-64, prevalence of active hepatitis B infection is similar among HIV positive and HIV negative individuals.
Although the estimate for HIV positive individuals (5.2 percent) is slightly higher compared with HIV negative individuals
(3.6 percent), the estimates are not statistically different. These are the first national estimates of hepatitis B in Tanzania
and will be foundational for developing the national hepatitis response.

CONCLUSIONS

· HIV prevalence and incidence estimates from THIS indicate a stabilizing HIV epidemic in Tanzania.

· Tanzania has made considerable progress towards the 90-90-90 goals, particularly in linkage to and retention in HIV
 treatment as demonstrated by the 2nd and 3rd 90 targets (91 and 88 percent, respectively).

· The goal of ending the AIDS epidemic in Tanzania by 2030 is attainable through improvement in targeted HIV testing, in
 men and women.

RESPONSE RATES AND HIV TESTING METHODS

Of 15,504 eligible households, 14,811 (95 percent) completed a household interview. Of 19,852 eligible women and 16,235
eligible men ages 15 years and older, 90 percent of women and 85 percent of men were interviewed and tested for HIV. Of
10,452 eligible children ages 0 to 14 years, 92 percent were tested for HIV. A representative subsample of 1,310 adults ages 15
years and older were tested for hepatitis B.

HIV prevalence testing was conducted in each household using a serological rapid diagnostic testing algorithm based on
Tanzania's national guidelines, with laboratory confirmation of seropositive samples using the BioRad Geenius HIV-1/HIV-2
supplemental assay. Viral load testing was conducted on all positive samples. A laboratory-based incidence testing algorithm
(HIV-1 Limiting Antigen (LAg) avidity plus viral load) was used to distinguish recent from long-term infection, and incidence
estimates were obtained using the CDC Incidence Calculator, which uses the formula recommended by the WHO Incidence
Working Group and Consortium for Evaluation and Performance of Incidence Assays, with time cutoff (T)=1.0 year and
residual proportion false recent (PFR)=0.00. Survey weights are utilized for all estimates.

                                                                           5

Population Based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) Project
which is a multi-country project funded by PEPFAR to
conduct national HIV-focused surveys that describe the
status of the HIV epidemic. Results will measure important
national and regional HIV-related parameters, including
progress toward 90-90-90 goals, and will guide policy
and funding priorities. ICAP at Columbia University is
implementing the PHIA Project in close collaboration with
CDC and other partners.
