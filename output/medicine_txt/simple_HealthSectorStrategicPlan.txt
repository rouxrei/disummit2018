"Partnership for Delivering the MDGs"

Foreword
Focus of the third Health Sector Strategic Plan 2009 ­ 2015 (HSSP III), will be
on "Partnership for delivering the Millennium Development Goals".             Year 2015
is the target year for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs)     and the   end year    for  the HSSP     III. This  strategic  plan  therefore,
contributes to Tanzania's efforts to reduce child and maternal mortality and to
control important infectious diseases, as well as, in its efforts to improve the
environment and access to clean water. We believe that, the health sector
can make an important contribution to the reduction of poverty and hunger in
Tanzania. The Government of Tanzania is fully committed to achieving the
MDGs, which are part of the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of
Poverty  (in  Kiswahili: MKUKUTA).        Although      in recent   years,  progress  has
been  made    in the  reduction    of child and    infant  mortality,  the  maternal  and
neonatal   mortality  remain,   persistently   high. There    is still some  work   to be
done, before Tanzania can claim that, it has achieved its MDGs.

In the coming years, the health sector will embark on two major programmes,
the Primary Health Services Development Programme (in Kiswahili: MMAM)
and the Human Resources for Health Strategic Plan. These programmes will
improve accessibility and quality of health services and contribute to achieving
the MDGs.     The   programmes     are    important  in    improving   the  health of  the
population.   Thus, the focus of the HSSP III is on Partnership.

The Decentralisation by Devolution (D-by-D) policy of the Government, has
put the Local Government Authorities (LGAs), in charge of delivering social
services and has given the Prime Minister's Office -            Regional Administration
and  Local    Government   (PMO-RALG),          the  task    to  monitor/supervise    and
coordinate    their activities, in line   with the   policies    and   guidelines  of  the
Sectoral Ministries. In the area of Health, other Ministries, Departments and
Agencies, are    also supposed        to support the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare,   in  improving   the   health   of   its people,     i.e. through   education,
agriculture or water supply. The health sector has to work in partnership with
all government institutions that are responsible for services that have impact
on health.

Partnership with the private sector is also necessary, to increase accessibility
and quality of health services.       The private sector consists of all non-state
actors,  i.e.  Faith  Based     Organisations,     Non-Government          Organisations,
Community Based Organisations and all other Private Health Providers. The
Service  Agreements      between      Government     and    Private  Service  Providers,
offer opportunities for a regulated collaboration. We believe that, by joining
hands, with all who can provide services to improve the health of the people,
is beneficial for the Development of the Country.

Our  Development       Partners    provide    the  health    sector    with the   needed
financial, technical   and moral      support.  In   2008,    a  new   Memorandum      of
Understanding for the Health Basket Fund was signed, which is an important

                                            i
signal of  the mutual     trust, between     the  Government    and   Development
Partners. The well-established Sector Wide Approach in Tanzania offers all
partners an opportunity, to contribute to better health in Tanzania.      Important
partners,  who   are  also   beneficiaries     of  the  health  services,  are  the
communities and families, that have to take ownership of their own health,
such as, healthy lifestyles, early treatment and adequate care at home, that
can save  many   lives. All efforts  in the  health  sector  should  be focused on
mobilizing them to collaborate for better health, starting from the level of the
household.

Last but not least, our health and social welfare workers, especially those who
on  a  day-to-day basis,    are  in contact   with  patients and  clients, are  our
partners  and  representatives.   They  paint  a  good  face to  the health sector,
create trust in the communities and deliver quality care, often at odd hours or
in remote places. The Ministry will, therefore ensure that, good performance is
achieved and better rewarded, and that, our health workers are motivated to
achieve the MDGs.

This HSSP III will be the guiding reference document, for the preparation of
the five-year Regional Strategic Plans, as well as, hospital and Council Health
Strategic Plans.  It will also    guide  the   formulation  of specific  plans and
programmes, including annual plans, at all levels. I therefore, invite you all to
join the Health Sector, in its efforts to achieve the MDGs.

Acknowledgement
The  strategic    plan   is  an important      document         in achieving     the  Millennium
Development       Goals   (MDGs).       The   Ministry     of   Health     and   Social   Welfare
through its ongoing health sector reforms, has developed this strategic plan,
through   extensive     consultations    with    all    stakeholders,      to guide    on  priority
setting and deployment of resources, in the health sector. In the process of
developing     this plan,   adequate     analysis       of the  current    situation   has   been
made and future needs of the health and social welfare services have been
identified.
This third  Health     Sector   Strategic     Plan,      builds on     the experiences     of the
second   Health     Sector   Strategic   Plan,       and   provides    continuity.  Most   of the
strategies of the previous plan are updated in this plan, and new strategies
are  added,    where    appropriate     (i.e. on     emergency      preparedness       and social
welfare). Together, the strategies provide a comprehensive overview of the
intentions, for the improvement of the health sector.
The  topics    on   cross    cutting    issues,        use the     same    strategic   intentions
approach, but from a different angle, and provides the readers, information on
how   the   Government         will tackle    issues       of equity,    gender,     quality  and
governance.    This    document      explains,       the governance      arrangements      of the
health sector, and the monitoring and evaluation of this strategic Plan. It also
provides information on, planned income and expenditure in the health sector.
For the sake of overview, this plan restricts itself to the main issues, leaving
details to specific strategic plans of institutions and programmes. Annual work
plans will provide operational information.
Preparation    of   this  strategic     plan   was       done   in  a   participatory   manner,
involving experts from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, PMO-RALG
and  other  Ministries,     as well  as,    Local      Government      Authorities,  the  Private
Sector   and   Development       Partners.       Technical      Planning      Groups   convened
several times, in meetings and retreats, to perform a situation analysis and to
formulate strategic priorities for this plan. More than 200 people contributed to
the preparation of the plan. The Health Sector Reform Secretariat coordinated
the  production     of  this   strategic    plan     and   edited   the    final version   of the
document. The plan was approved at the Joint Annual Health Sector Review,
of October 2008.
I would   like to   express    my   profound     gratitude    to   all who    contributed  to the
completion     of this  plan.   The   success        of  this plan   relies   on  the  continued
commitment     of   all stakeholders,       within     the government,        non-governmental
organisations, partners and users of the services we provide.
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is committed, to the implementation
of  this plan,    and   shall   utilise  it   as     a  reference   document       for  planning,
monitoring and evaluation.

Introduction
This third Health Sector Strategic Plan reflects the strategic intentions of the health sector for
the period 2009 ­ 2015. It does not go into detail of operational activities, which are provided
in specific strategic plans and work plans of institutions and programmes. This document is a
guide for strategic planning at sub-national levels and for annual planning.

Health and Poverty Situation
Tanzania  is   classified  by the   UN  as     one of the   least developed    countries.  About  25   %  of
Tanzanians were living below the poverty line in 2007. Over the past ten years Under Five
Mortality Rate and Infant Mortality have reduced. However Maternal Mortality and Neonatal
Mortality remain persistently high. The health system is gradually expanding, but not enough
to cover the unmet needs of the population. There is an acute shortage of staff: only 35% of
the required personnel is in place to provide health services.

Government policies
The health sector is guided by national policies, such as Government Reforms. The National
Strategy  for  Growth     and Poverty   Reduction     (MKUKUTA)        provides  the   global direction   for
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Health Policy was updated
in 2007, providing the Government's vision on long-term developments in the health sector.
The   Health   Sector     Reform    programme        continues    with  further  strengthening    of Local
Government     Authorities  and    hospitals   to improve    performance.   The  Primary   Health   Service
Development     Programme      (MMAM)       aims  at improving    accessibility and   quality of the health
services. The Human Resources for Health plan targets at solving the human resources crisis
in the sector.

HSSP III Framework
HSSP III consists of four dimensions: Eleven strategies focus on specific topics in the health
service delivery related to diseases and management. The crosscutting issues elaborate on
the approach towards quality, equity, gender and governance. The document explains which
types  of services     are  provided    in   the   health   sector, and   also   explains  the   roles   and
responsibilities of each level in the health system.

HSSP III Strategies
1.  Accessibility   to    District Health    Services   will   be improved,     amongst   others    through
    implementation      of  the    Primary     Health Care     Strengthening    Programme      (MMAM      in
    Kiswahili). All facilities will provide a complete package of essential health interventions in
    accordance      with   the     guidelines   for   their  level.  Community       involvement    will  be
    strengthened,      to improve    health.   The    referral system    in the  district (horizontal    and
    vertical) will be strengthened to ensure appropriate treatment for patients.
    The Tanzania Quality Improvement Framework (TQIF) provides guidance for introduction
    of quality  assurance     systems,      including accreditation.   Supervision    by  Regional   Health
    Management       Teams     (RHMTs)      and    Regional    Hospital  staff  will contribute  to  quality
    improvement.
    With regard to management of District Health Services, further decentralisation to health
    facilities will improve   results-based     planning    and implementation.      Further  integration of
    MOHSW and LGA management systems will streamline operations.
    Performance-based systems like Pay-for-Performance (P4P) will enhance motivation and
    productivity of health workers
2.  Referral Hospital Services will be more accessible to patients who need advanced care
    through    an   adequate       referral  system,   and     measures     to  prevent   bypass    will  be
    established.    The quality of care will improve by implementation of the TQIF; hospitals will
    have  a    Quality Assurance     unit   to promote  quality.   The  hospital  reform  programme      will
    improve financial management and human resource management. Hospitals will develop
    strategic   plans  and    capital investment      plans.   Hospital boards   will  ensure    community
    participation in management.
3.  The central level support by headquarters' departments and agencies will be streamlined.
    More functions will be delegated to operational levels. Further integration of programmes

                                                      5
    will lead   to more    coherence      in  the provision      of health   services.    Headquarters        will
    introduce an effective system for annual action planning.
    Strengthening of RHMTs will be an important tool for technical supervision on behalf of
    the  MOHSW.       Zonal  Resources      Centres    will  provide   training and   technical     support    to
    training institutions.
4.  Increasing numbers and improvement of the quality of human resources for health (HRH)
    are essential for improving accessibility and quality of health services. HRH planning and
    information    system   will be    strengthened.      Recruitment     and   retention     of staff   will be
    institutionalised in close collaboration with LGAs. The introduction of performance-based
    systems will improve motivation and productivity of health staff. Continuing Professional
    Development     (CPD)   is  necessary     to keep     health workers   updated.     Training    institutions
    will increase  their  production    by   higher   numbers    of graduates    and    will improve     training
    quality through update of curricula.
5.  Health  Care   Financing    is fundamental      for realising   the ambitions    of  the    MOHSW.      The
    Ministry  aims    at  increasing    the   health   budget    to  15%    of  the   Government         budget.
    Increasing   the  funding    through    the  Health    Basket    Fund   is  an  advantageous         way   of
    resource    mobilisation.   The    Ministry  will develop    strategies  to  increase     complementary
    financing through the Community Health Fund and National Health Insurance Fund. The
    management       of   these  funds   will be  strengthened       and   a regulatory      body   for   health
    insurances   will be   created.    Increased    collaboration    with the   private sector      will provide
    opportunities for investments in health.
6.  Public Private Partnerships will be important for achieving the goals of the health sector.
    PPP    forums    will be    installed  at   national,    regional   and  district   level.   The     Service
    Agreements will be used in all LGAs to contract private providers for service delivery.
    The private training institutions will be increasingly involved in production of HRH, based
    on their specific competencies.
7.  The   One   Plan  for  Maternal     Newborn     and   Child  Health   (MNCH)     will    be  implemented,
    addressing   priority  Reproductive      and  MNC     Health    interventions   including    key  maternal
    and   child  health   interventions    with   focus   on   youth,   family   planning     and    nutritional
    services. MNCH will also improve through general measures like increasing the number
    of   primary health    facilities, increasing     the number     of competent       staff and    improving
    equipment    and    supplies   in  health facilities.   An improved     referral  system     will increase
    access to emergency obstetric care. Communities will be more involved in MNCH in order
    to improve reproductive health practices.
8.  Disease   control   programmes      will  similarly benefit  from   general     improvements      in  health
    facilities. The diagnostic capacity in laboratories and provision of equipment and supplies
    will improve.   The   TQIF   will   stimulate   further   introduction   of treatment     guidelines      and
    clinical standards.
    The HIV/AIDS programme will continue increasing access to ARV treatment to PMTCT
    and  Post   Exposure    Prophylaxis.     Prevention   and    Voluntary   Counselling     and    Testing   will
    be   stimulated,  as  well  as  treatment    of   sexually   transmitted   diseases.     All hospitals    will
    guarantee safe blood transfusions.
    In the malaria programme universal access to evidence-based malaria interventions will
    be   scaled  up,  including    effective   diagnosis     and    treatment,  Long-Lasting        Insecticide-
    treated Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS).
    The tuberculosis programme will continue the Stop TB strategy, while vigilance for Multi
    Drug Resistant TB will be high. The leprosy eradication strategy and disability prevention
    programme will be implemented in all districts.
    There will be more targeted attention on neglected diseases, even when such diseases
    are limited to have regional importance. This will be achieved through training of staff and
    provision of medicines to reduce unnecessary suffering and death.
    Non-Communicable        Diseases       become     more     and   more    important    with    the    shifting
    demographic     situation   and    modern   lifestyles.  More   attention   for healthier    lifestyles   and
    better treatment will be stimulated.
    With  regard   to environmental     health,   the  focus   will be  on implementing       the   new   Public
    Health Bill, and on introducing adequate measures for adherence to legislation.
9.  Emergency      Preparedness       and  Response       is a  new   theme     in  the strategic     plan,   but
    increasingly   important     due    to   globalisation    of  health   threats    that    may    come     up
    unexpectedly.     Capacity     building   at  all   levels   is planned     to  prevent      or deal    with
    emergencies. Quick mobilisation of resources will be realised, when needed.

                                                      6
10.  Social  Welfare   is  a  new   and challenging    theme      in the   HSSP.     The capacity      to  provide
     social  welfare   and    protection    services  must     be    built in  all   districts. The    regulatory
     framework    will  be   developed   and     community-based          programmes     will    be  initiated   or
     strengthened, shifting from a charity approach to a rights-based approach.
11. Monitoring & Evaluation help to improve evidence-based decision-making and to enhance
     public  accountability.   The    Ministry will  develop     a   comprehensive       M&E     and   Research
     policy and strategy, to ensure integration and harmonisationof these activities. Integration
     of the MOHSW monitoring systems with the PMO-RALG and MKUKUTA systems will be
     pursued. The Health Management Information System will be revisited. At national level
     there  will be  data  warehouses,      where   information    from    several   sources     is merged    and
     used for further analysis. Health systems research and other research will be stimulated.
12. Other issues
     Capital investments      are   required  to expand     the   health   service    network.   Standards     for
     infrastructure,   maintenance,     equipments,    and     means   of   transport   will be   developed      or
     revised to increase efficiency and quality. The MOHSW and zonal workshops will provide
     support to districts and hospitals.
     Medicines    and  medical     supplies  should  never     be  missing     in health facilities.   The  zonal
     warehousing     and   distribution of  medicines     will be  improved.      Management        of medicines
     and supplies    at   district and  health   facility level   will be   improved,    together      with more
     rational prescription of medicines.

Crosscutting issues
·    Quality improvement       is   a major    aim  of    the  Ministry:    in  service  delivery,     in  human
     resources and in management.
·    Equity  needs     to  be emphasised:      geographic      equity  for   underserved        populations   and
     equity for vulnerable groups who cannot fend for themselves.
·    Gender  in   health   needs    attention due  to the   specific   health     needs  of  women     and   men.
     Health  services     should   be increasingly    alert   to respond      to  such  needs,      especially   of
     women who are more vulnerable to health problems. The involvement of men in family
     programmes will be stimulated.
·    Communities     own    their   health: healthier  lifestyles    will  reduce    suffering.   Ownership      of
     health should also extend to participation in management of health facilities, in order to
     make those facilities more responsive to specific local health needs.
·    Coherence     between    health    reforms   and   health    programmes,        MKUKUTA         and   MDGs
     activities,  government        reforms    and    LGA      reforms     will    enhance      efficiency    and
     effectiveness.
·    The   health    sector   will  benefit   from   complementarity:          more   delegation       and  more
     partnerships, cutting back duplication and unhealthy competition.

Managing the health sector
All stakeholders have to play their role. The MOHSW headquarters will concentrate more on
its stewardship      role, and     delegate   more    operational      tasks   to    LGAs,   PMO-RALG         and
departments      and agencies.     Coordination  with  other     Ministries,   partnerships     with   the Private
Sector and with Development Partners will enhance the implementation of the strategic plan.
Mechanisms are in place for joint planning, monitoring and evaluation through the SWAp.

Financing the health sector
There  has   been    a gradual   increase   in Government        funding   to  health  over  the    last  years. It
may be expected that this increase will continue. Also the funding through the Health Basket
Fund will increase. However, due to planned large investments, there will still be an estimated
funding gap of 24% during the implementation period of the strategic plan. Innovative ways of
raising funds, from Government, from Development Partners and from the Private Sector will
be used to fill this gap.

Monitoring and Evaluation
A   coherent system     of quarterly,   annual   and  periodic    monitoring      is planned,    using   selected
indicators. Coherence between MOHSW and LGA monitoring and discipline in reporting will
ensure   timely    and     reliable  provision   of   information      on   progress     and     constraints     in
implementation of the strategic plan.

1   Introduction
1.1     Introduction to the HSSP III

This Health Sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP III) is the crosscutting strategic plan for the health
sector of Tanzania for the period July 2009 ­ June 2015.             It provides   an   overview    of the
priority strategic directions across the sector which are guided by the National Health Policy,
Vision2025,    the   National     Programme     for  Economic      Growth    and   Poverty    Reduction
(MKUKUTA in Kiswahili) and the Millennium Development Goals. Detailed policies, strategies
and work plans are in place for health related issues and for disease control (see table 6).
HSSP III does not reiterate those, but summarises their strategic directions. It serves as the
guiding document for development of Council and hospital strategic plans and for annual work
plans.

The  Second   Health   Sector    Strategic Plan  2003   ­ 2008  (HSSP    II)  was  extended   until  June
2009,  in  order   to incorporate     the  findings  and  recommendations       of the     Joint External
Evaluation  of the   Health   Sector,   which was   conducted   in 2007,   in the  formulation   of  Third
Health Sector Strategic Plan 2009 ­ 2015 (HSSP III). The formulation process of the HSSP III
was lead by the Health Sector Reform Secretariat under the Division of Policy and Planning,
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), involving key stakeholders from Ministries,
Departments    and   Agencies     (MDAs),  including  the Prime  Minister's   Office   for Regional    and
Local Government (PMO-RALG). The private sector and Development Partners participated
in the preparation.

The  HSSP    III  was    adopted     at the   Joint Annual   Health   Sector    Review     2008   for  the
implementation period July 2009 to June 2015. After this six-year' period health plans will be
synchronised with the Government planning cycle starting in 2015. The HSSP III consolidates
existing Health Sector Reforms. It retains the key strategic priorities of the HSSP II, adding
some   new   priorities    identified   namely  Social    Welfare,  Emergency      Preparedness        and
Response and Maternal, Newborn and Child Health.

The structure of the document is as follows. This first chapter provides general background
information on the health situation and health services structure in the country. The second
chapter summarises       the   most   important Tanzanian    development      and  health   policies   and
strategies. Chapter    3  provides    the strategic  framework   of the  HSSP     III. In  chapter  4  the
eleven strategies are presented and explained, while in chapter 5 the crosscutting themes are
elaborated.  Chapter     6    summarises   the  strategies  in tables   for  quick overview      of major
strategic objectives and targets. Chapter 7 explains how the management of the health sector
is planned.  Chapter    8  provides     information on  the financing   of  the sector    and chapter    9
explains on the monitoring of the implementation of HSSP III.

1.2     Background Information
1.2.1   Geography and Population
The United Republic of Tanzania is a union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar, which was
formed  in  April 1964.    It is the  largest country  in East  Africa, occupying      an  area  of about
945,087 sq. km, and has common boarder with 8 neighbouring countries.

1.2.2    Poverty situation

Tanzania  is classified by  the UN  as one  of the  least developed  countries. The  average
national income  (GNI)  per person  was US$350   in 2006.   About 25 %  of Tanzanians   were
living below the poverty line in 2007. The incidence of poverty in rural areas was 39 per cent;
in Dar es Salaam it was 18 percent.

In the period 2006 - 2007, real GDP growth was 6%. Also GDP in agriculture has increased in
recent years. The GDP growth has not reduced poverty in an equitable manner. Productivity
has remained   low,  especially among   smallholder farmers   who  constitute the majority of
agricultural producers in Tanzania. A combination of low production, low productivity and low
quality of agricultural produce has significant limiting effects on rural growth and therefore on
poverty reduction.

The enrolment in primary schools is close to universal. However, attendance rates are lower
than enrolment, with little gender differential, though boys tend to be in school at an older age
than girls. Children with disabilities are much less likely to be in school than other children.
The number of teachers lags behind the increasing enrolment.

Overall, the 2004/05 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey reports that 10 % of children
under the age of 18 have lost their mother, or their father, or both. In 10 districts more than
15% of children have been orphaned.

                                             9
Less than 40% of rural households have access to an improved source of drinking water.                   In
seven districts, less than 10 % of households have such access. Over 90 % of households
report having toilet facilities ­ mostly pit latrines of which a considerable part does not meet
hygienic standards.

Tanzania has made some important progress in the last decade to address gender inequality,
for example    in establishing   quotas   for   female  representation    in Parliament,   increasing    the
number and position of women in cabinet, dramatically boosting elementary school enrolment
of  boys and   girls, and  in  correcting    discriminatory laws.  However,     many   of  these changes
have not translated into real changes in the lives of the majority of the men and women in the
country, especially in rural areas.

1.2.3    Health situation and link with poverty

Over the past ten years positive trends on different health indicators have been seen with a
decreasing Under Five Mortality Rate and Infant Mortality. Other positive developments have
been  seen  concerning     the  coverage     of child immunisation    and    vitamin A supplementation.
Contrary, almost three quarters of children under five are anaemic and chronic malnutrition is
still common (table 2).

Factors  influencing   the  positive  trends    include sustained  high   coverage    of  vaccination  and
increased   coverage    of  effective   interventions,    e.g. vitamin A   distribution.   75%   of   health
facilities are providing immunisation services. The IMCI strategy was adopted in Tanzania in
1996 as a key strategy for reduction of Under Five Mortality and presently 93.8% of districts
are implementing      IMCI. More   effective    prevention  and  treatment   of malaria   are  likely to be
important   contributors    to improved      health,  especially  in  reducing   infant   and  under-five
mortality.

Stunting                                      44% (1996)         38%          Height for age
Under-weight                                                     22%          Weight for age

However,    there  remain   substantial      urban-rural, regional   and  socio-economic      differences.
Rural poor   children   are   more    likely than their   urban  counterparts   to   die, and  when    they
survive,  they   are  more  likely to  be malnourished.     Analysis   of infant mortality  in the    1990s
suggests a widening gap between the poorest and less poor.

Life expectancy at birth was estimated at 53 years in the national projections report, 2006,
based  on  the   Population    and Household     Census    in  2002. The   three main     causes of   death
among adults are malaria, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, for children below five years of age
they are malaria, pneumonia and anaemia.

The maternal mortality ratio is estimated at 578/100,000 live births. More than 50% of women
aged 19 years are pregnant or already mothers, increasing their vulnerability to sexual and
reproductive health (RH) problems.

Micronutrient    deficiencies  and    chronic   energy    deficiency  (low   body    mass   index)  during
pregnancy   increase    the risk   of maternal   mortality  and  poor  outcomes    for infants,  including

                                                     10
preterm delivery, foetal growth retardation, low birth weight, increased risk of dying, impaired
cognitive development and increased risk of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) later in life.

There are some geographic concentrations of districts, which have a more general pattern of
relatively poor indicators. Districts in the Southeast have the worst adult literacy rates, under
five mortality  rates and   access   to  improved  water. There  is more  and   more   evidence    of  an
increasing  rural  urban    divide, with  pockets  of poverty   and ill-health  in remote   rural  areas,
where  services   are poor,    people's  capacities to improve   their  own health   are   minimal,   and
thus disease statistics are worse.

1.2.4  Health System in Tanzania

Mainland   Tanzania    is   divided  into 21  administrative    regions and    113   districts with   133
Councils. There are a total of about 10,342 villages. Primary Health Care services form the
basis of the pyramidal structure of health care services. Both public and private providers are
working in dispensaries, health centres and at least one hospital at the district level. Currently
there are 4,679 dispensaries and 481 health centres throughout the country. About 90% of
population lives within five kilometres of a primary health facility.

There are 55 district hospitals owned by Government and 13 Designated District Hospitals,
owned by Faith Based Organisations (FBO). Furthermore, there are 86 other hospitals at first
referral level (owned by Government, parastatals and private sector). There are 18 Regional
Hospitals,  functioning     as  referral  hospital for district hospitals   and    8 consultancy      and
specialised    hospitals in  the country.  Government     staffing  norms   for health  facilities exist.
When   comparing      these  to  existing level of  staffing only  35%   of positions   are    filled with
qualified health workers, leaving Tanzania with a severe human resource crisis.

 Tanzania     has         decentralised     many      Government          functions         through      Decentralisation          by
 Devolution.       Local    Government        Authorities       (LGAs)        are responsible          for delivering      public
 services in local health, primary education, agriculture extension and livestock, water supply,
 and local road maintenance.

In medical,  paramedical, or technical areas,   Tanzania  has  116 training institutions of which
government owns 72 and 44 are owned by the private sector and faith based organisations.
There are also seven medical universities, of which six are privately owned. The total annual
intake in the pre-service training institutions has been  increasing over   the past 4   year with
enrolment of 3,500 students in 2007. The total output from health training institutions in the
past nine years was 23,536, which is not sufficient to cover the needs.

The  MOHSW      and PMORALG     in collaboration   with Public Service Management      Office  are
responsible for recruitment and distribution of health staff throughout the country. Shortage of
health staff in remote areas is a  reason for   concern  and emergency   plans   for tackling this
situation have been developed.

2   Government policies
2.1       Policy and Aid Framework

In  Tanzania   a   coherent     system    of   Government     policies,  legislations,   strategies  and
programmes is emerging, giving direction to development. Consistency between general and
sectoral policies is increasing. Step-by-step a national framework for monitoring of economic
and  social development      is created   into  which   sectors provide  input.  Devolution  has  a  far-
reaching impact on the health sector, whereby Local Government Authorities have become
responsible  and   the MOHSW         has  withdrawn     from  direct service provision   at district and
municipal level.

2.2       General Policy Framework

Vision 2025

The  Arusha    Declaration      in 1967    was   the  first  vision  document    of the   country    after
independence.    The  Vision    2025  (formulated    in 1998)   can  be considered   an  update  of  that
declaration. Tanzania   Vision     2025   is a  document    providing  direction and   a philosophy   for
long-term development. Tanzania wants to achieve by 2025 a high quality of livelihood for its
citizens, peace,   stability and   unity, good  governance,     a well-educated   and   learning society
and a competitive economy capable of producing sustainable growth and shared benefits.

The document identifies health as one of the priority sectors contributing to a higher quality
livelihood for all Tanzanians.     This   is expected   to be attained  through  strategies, which    will
ensure realisation of the following health service goals:
·   Access to quality primary health care for all;
·   Access to quality reproductive health service for all individuals of appropriate ages;
·   Reduction   in  infant   and   maternal   mortality rates by  three  quarters   of current levels  in
    1998;
·   Universal access to clean and safe water;
·   Life expectancy comparable to the level attained by typical middle-income countries.
·   Food self sufficiency and food security;
·   Gender equality and empowerment of women in all health parameters.

                                                   14
MKUKUTA

The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP), known in Kiswahili as
the  MKUKUTA        (Mkakati   wa    Kukuza   Uchumi     na  Kupunguza        Umaskini    Tanzania)      was
approved     by  Cabinet   in  February   2005   for   implementation     over    five  years   and   is  the
successor    to the  Poverty   Reduction   Strategy  Paper.   The  MKUKUTA          is informed  by   Vision
2025   and   committed   to  the achievement     of the  Millennium  Development        Goals   (MDGs).    It
focuses    on  growth  and   governance,   and   is  a framework   for    all government      development
efforts and for mobilising resources.

The  MKUKUTA      aims   to  foster  greater collaboration   among   all  sectors   and   stakeholders.    It
has mainstreamed cross-cutting issues (gender, environment, HIV/AIDS, disability, children,
youth, elderly, employment and settlements). All sectors are involved in a collaborative effort
rather   than  segmented    activities. Therefore   this document    is   of  crucial  importance   for   the
MOHSW strategies.
The MKUKUTA seeks to deepen ownership and inclusion in policy making, paying attention
to  address    laws  and   customs   that  retard   development    and    negatively     affect  vulnerable
groups. The strategy identifies three clusters of broad outcomes:
    (i)       Growth and reduction of income poverty;
    (ii)      Improvement of quality of life and social well -being, and
    (iii)     Good governance.

Health is part of the second cluster, improvement of quality of life and social wellbeing.

The  MKUKUTA        Monitoring   Master  Plan  (MMM)     of 2006   outlines     the guiding   principles  of
national   development   monitoring,    which  also  has  a  bearing on    sector   monitoring    activities.
The MKUKUTA monitoring framework offers the basis for progress monitoring of national and
sectoral activities, contributing to poverty reduction. The framework defines the frequency and
type  of   reporting,  both   on  achievements      and   on  finances.    Health      sector   reporting  is
incorporated in the MKUKUTA reporting.

The  MKUKUTA         Monitoring   System   routinely   prepares    national     reports  on   the  national
indicators (including health). It produces a Poverty and Human Development Report (PHDR)
every    two  years. In  the  year  when   the   PHDR    is not produced,       a Status   Report   on    the
indicators is prepared. Like the PHDR, this report analyses the current data against baselines
and targets. Various Development Partners (DPs) use the information provided in the PHDR
to assess progress. They base their budget support decisions on this information, instead of
performing parallel evaluations.

2.3       Local Government Policy and Aid Framework

Local Government Reform and Decentralization by Devolution (D-by-D)

Since 1994 Tanzania has embarked on a Local Government Reforms Programme (LGRP).
The  aim   of the reforms   is to establish  decentralisation   by devolution     (D-by-D).   This  implies
that Local Government Authorities (LGAs) take full responsibility for planning, budgeting and
management of government services, including health, education, and water supply.

In  the  country  there  are  133  Councils,  in districts, municipalities    and   towns.  There   are   21
Regions.    At  national level   the councils  are   overseen   by   the   Prime    Minister's   Office   for
Regional    Administration   and  Local   Government     (PMO-RALG).         At the    national level laws,
systems and guidelines are developed, helping Local Government Authorities to perform their
tasks.

In 1996 the Government decided to restructure the regional administration, giving more room
for development     of the  Councils.   Regions  became     facilitators, rather  than   implementers.    In
the devolution process the Regional Health Management Teams became part of the Regional
Administration, instead of being part of the MOHSW.

                                                    15
A new LGRP phase for the period July 2008 ­ June 2013 has started, which aims to eliminate
the institutional,  legal, organisational   and  operational     bottlenecks  to  realisation   of D-by-D
policy at all levels of government, and improve collaboration with line ministries. There will be
further fiscal decentralisation, and further decentralisation of human resources management.
Line ministries will delegate more operational tasks to LGAs. The LGRP will build the capacity
of LGAs   to be  efficient  and  effective  organisations    in  the planning   and  implementation      for
delivery  of  basic    social  services,    socio-economic      development     and   poverty   reduction
interventions. The LGRP will empower citizens to demand accountability and integrity as well
as efficient and effective use of public resources.

The Government of Tanzania (GOT), through PMO-RALG, implements the Local Government
Capital Development Grant (LGCDG). This system provides discretionary development funds
for rehabilitation and expansion of infrastructure to local authorities. Over time the LGCDG is
intended to become the mechanism through which all development funds will be transferred
to  Local  Government       Authorities   (LGAs),    in   accordance     with   GOT's    commitment      to
Decentralization    by Devolution.    A  separate   window    for  health   for rehabilitation  of  health
facilities has been established in 2008.

2.4      Health Sector Policies, Strategies and Programmes

Health Sector Reform

Health Sector Reforms (HSR) started in 1994 and aims at improvement of access, quality and
efficiency health service delivery. Primary health care was adopted as the most cost-effective
strategy  to improve    health  of  the   people.   The   major  focus   of  the  HSR    is therefore    on
strengthening   the  District  Health    Services,  as  well as   strengthening    and   reorientation   of
secondary    and tertiary  service  delivery  in hospitals   in  support  of  primary   health  care.   The
programme     also  aims    at strengthening     of support   services   at   the central   level,  in  the
MOHSW, it agencies and training institutions. The HSR introduced a programmatic approach,
replacing the project approach, in order to create coherence between activities and continuity.
Initially a Plan of Work was developed defining the priorities of the reforms, which in 2003 was
replaced by the HSSP II.

The  Health   Sector   Reforms     are   in the  following   dimensions:     decentralisation   of  health
services; financial reforms, such as enhancement of user-charges in government hospitals,
introduction of  health  insurance    and   community     health funds  and   public/private   partnership
reforms such as encouragement of private sector to complement public health services. They
also include organisational reforms such as integration of vertical health programmes into the
general  health    services;   and propagation      of demand     oriented   researches     in the  health
sector.  In a later stage hospital reforms were added as element of the reforms, because the
quality of hospital services was not improving in line with the sector reforms.

The HSR got a new dimension when local government and public service reforms programme
gained momentum and devolution was introduced in 2001: District Health Services became
part of the Local Government Authority. New relations with other government players in the
health  sector  were   established    in the  context   of these   reforms.   The  need   for  systematic
planning, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation became more urgent, now the MOHSW
was  separated      from   most    of  the   operational    functions  in   district  health   care.    The
Comprehensive      Council   Health   Plan  was   introduced    as   management      instrument,   offering
stakeholders full insight into the Councils' health activities.

Following the introduction of a new budgetary instrument, by the MOF in 2001, the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) was developed to incorporate the necessary planning
and  financing   of the  three  year   programme       of work   for the Ministry    of Health,    for both
recurrent and development activities into one document.

                                                    16
Important in the HSR was building up the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) as mechanism for
sustainable  relations  with   other service providers in health  and   with Development     Partners
(DPs). An important achievement under the HSR was the introduction of the Health Basket
Fund in 1999. From 2002 onwards the Councils started to receive funds from the HBF. Under
the SWAp the mechanism for collaboration between the health sector and the DPs has been
regulated.

Health Policy

The MOHSW has revised the 1990 National Health Policy and the revised Health Policy 2007
has    been  approved.        Ongoing  socio-economic     changes,  new     government     directives,
emerging and re-emerging diseases and changes in science and technology necessitated to
update the policy. The policy outlines achievements and challenges facing the health sector.
The resource constraints (especially human resources) constitute the major problem for not
being able to cope adequately with health problems.

The vision of the Government is to have a healthy society, with improved social wellbeing that
will   contribute effectively to personal and   national development.     The mission   is to provide
basic   health services   in  accordance  to  geographical    conditions,  which are   of  acceptable
standards, affordable and sustainable.       The health services will focus on those most at risk
and will satisfy the needs of the citizens in order to increase the lifespan of all Tanzanians.

Specifically the Government aims to:
(i)       Reduce morbidity and mortality in order to increase the lifespan of all Tanzanians by
          providing quality health care;
(ii)      Ensure that basic health services are available and accessible;
(iii)     Prevent and control communicable and non- communicable diseases;
(iv)      Sensitise the citizens about the preventable diseases;
(v)       Create awareness to individual citizen on his/her responsibility on his/her health and
          health of the family;
(vi)      Improve partnership between public sector, private sector, religious institutions, civil
          society and community in provision of health services
(vii)     Plan, train, and increase the number of competent health staff;
(viii)    Identify and maintain the infrastructures and medical equipment; and
(ix)      Review   and  evaluate  health  policy, guidelines, laws and    standards   for provision of
          health services.

The document formulates health policies and statements in the following areas:
·         Preventive services: control disease incidences and disability
·         Epidemics: control communicable diseases, especially diseases from outside
·         Non-communicable diseases: promote healthier lifestyles and treat adequately
·         Maternal and child health: reduce maternal and child mortality in line with MDGs
·         Reproductive health: make services available especially for youth and men
·         Primary Health Care: make PHC accessible for all citizens
·         Health education and advocacy: Convey that every individual can improve his or her
          health status
·         Environmental    Health:   promote  a   sustainable healthy   environment    for the whole
          community
·         Occupational health: protect and improve workers' health status
·         Curative care: deliver safe health care services to the community
·         Medicines   and  supplies:  ensure  quality and  availability of sufficient medicines  and
          supplies
·         Safe Blood Transfusion: make safe blood available throughout the country
·         Mental health: promote mental health in the community and prevent illnesses

                                                  17
·        Traditional medicine and traditional midwives: increase coordination and partnerships
·        Cells and genome: develop proper use of technology of genetic engineering
·        Control of Food, Medicines, etc: ensure foods are safe and meet defined standards
·        Diagnosis of diseases: provide accurate diagnosis and forensic investigations
·        Quality improvement and standards: attain at least agreed minimum standards
·        Coordination in health sector: participatory, transparent and sustainable system for all
         stakeholders
·        Human resources development: provide sufficient staff with required skills mix

MMAM

In 2007 the MOHSW developed the Primary Health Care Service Development Programme
(PHCSDP). This programme is better known by the Kiswahili name of Mpango wa Maendeleo
ya Afya   ya  Msingi     2007-2017   (MMAM).     The     objective   of the  MMAM       programme    is to
accelerate the provision of primary health care services for all by 2012, while the remaining
five years of the programme will focus on consolidation of achievements.

The  main  areas    will be  strengthening   the health     systems,    rehabilitation, human    resource
development, the referral system, increase health sector financing and improve the provision
of medicines, equipment and supplies. This programme will be implemented by the Ministry of
Health   and Social  Welfare   in  collaboration   with  other  sectors   by  the existing  Government
administrative set-up including PMO-RALG, RSs, LGAs and Village Committees.

The first element   is   increasing the   workforce   in health  by    increasing the   throughput  in  the
existing training institutions by 100%, upgrading 4 schools for enrolled nurses, production of
health tutors and upgrading the skills of existing staff by provision IT skills and acquiring new
medical technology.

The  rehabilitation of   existing health   facilities and   construction  of new    ones,  as  to  have  a
dispensary in each village and a health centre in each ward, is planned as well as improving
the outreach services. This includes 8,107 primary health facilities, 62 district hospitals, and
128 training institutions by year 2012. The Referral System will be strengthened by improving
information communication system and transport.

The  Programme      will address   the revised   Health   Policy   and   the health  related   Millennium
Development     Goals  in the areas    of maternal    health,  child health  and  priority diseases.   The
programme costs are estimated to be around 11.8 trillion TSH, which is beyond the presently
available budget range. Innovative modalities of financing are therefore required.

HSSP II

The Health   Sector  Strategic    Plan II (HSSP  II)   articulated   a process of   health sector   reform
aimed at addressing the recognizable deficiencies in the sector and achieving specific goals
and  targets  in health   as  set  out in  the Millennium      Development     Goals    (MDGs)     and  the
National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA). According to the sector
evaluation in 2007 the HSSP II established the guiding framework for the implementation of
Government    policy   and  sector  reforms  as  well    as DPs'   assistance.  The    strategic planning
document   has   been    coherent   with  national    policies and   the priorities it  identified can  be
directly linked  to constraints   identified during    the   evaluation   at the  central,  regional   and
council levels.
The strategies included:    strengthening District Health Services, Hospital Reforms, role of the
Central   Ministry  and  Central  Support    Systems     for   health,  Human   Resources      for Health,
Health   sector  Financing,   Public   Private  Partnership,     sector   coordination     and HIV/AIDS
programming. (In Chapter 5 achievements and constraints in these areas are summarised.)
HSSP III to a large extent follows the structure of the HSSP II document, which has proved its
value in the past years.

Joint External Evaluation of the Health Sector in Tanzania 1999 ­ 2006

Main Evaluation Conclusions
1. The Sector Wide Approach has resulted in greater sector coherence and consistency.
2. The Health Basket Fund has been a particularly effective mechanism.
3. Global Health Initiatives and disease specific programmes have remained largely outside the planning
and priority setting structures in place at national and local level.
4.  The  programmes,     projects and   activities implemented       have  contributed   to improvements        in health
outcomes and to some improvements in the service quality.
5.  There has   not  been   significant progress   towards    achieving    goals  and  targets  relating     to maternal
mortality and maternal health (and to neonatal mortality).
6.  The  devolution  of  responsibilities for health    facilities to Local Government      Authorities   has    made  a
difference.
7.  Further   progress   towards  achieving   the    MDGs     and   MKUKUTA       is  required.    In particular,   more
effective management of human resources is an urgent requirement.
8.  There has   been   the  relative lack  of progress     in hospital  reform    and in the  implementation       of an
effective public private partnership.
9. The sector has not responded effectively to address some causes of unequal access.
10. Problems related to recruiting, posting and retaining staff at geographically isolated hospitals, health
centres and dispensaries have not been effectively addressed.

Major Recommendations
1.  The  Government     of Tanzania   and   Development     Partners    should  maintain    the SWAP     programming
format to structure their cooperation in the health sector.
2.  The  Government      of Tanzania    and   Development      Partners    should    make   every     effort to  provide
increased funding.
3. MOHSW and the Prime Minister's Office-Regional and Local Government should agree on a target
for budget to be allocated to Local Government Authorities.
4.  The  Health Basket     Fund  should   remain   a feature   of  the sector  during  HSSP3.      The  Health     Basket
Fund may be merged with the Health Block Grant.
5.  HSSP3     should  be   used   to consolidate     the achievements      of  HSSP2     and    to address      identified
constraints related to already agreed reforms.
6.  HSSP3   should   retain  the  strategic priorities  of HSSP2,      but should   also include    concrete    steps  to
accelerate progress in both hospital reform and public private partnership.
7.  Effective action  to reduce   maternal    mortality  and   improve     delivery services,   including    emergency
obstetric care, should be a stated strategic priority of HSSP3.
8. Improving equity of access should be a crosscutting theme of HSSP3.
9.  HSSP3   should   include  specific  strategies   to  improve    efficiency of service   delivery   both  in  Primary
Health   Facilities and  hospitals,  by  increasing    the productivity    of  health sector    personnel    and   better
matching staffing levels to work loads.
10. A health inspectorate (for which legislation has been prepared) should be established. 11. HSSP3
should include the development and implementation of an overall monitoring and evaluation framework
for  the  health    sector,  which   encompasses        both   regular   performance     monitoring      and     periodic
effectiveness evaluation.

Health Legislation
Government policies may require legislation to enforce adherence.
The existing health sector legislation is mainly divided into:
·   Public   Health legislation   which   is for  the control of  epidemics,   infectious diseases    and
    environmental health protection,
·   Health    professional    legislation  which   governs    the  practice    and  conduct   of    health
    professionals such as doctors, dental practitioners, pharmacists, nurses etc,
·   Legislation, which establishes autonomous health institutions for a particular need, such as
    institutions for medical research, national and special hospitals etc.
·   Health    financing  legislation,  which   is aiming   at providing  alternative  health   financing
    mechanism with the aim of complementing government efforts to finance health services in
    the country.
These laws need to be effectively implemented in order to accomplish the intended objectives of
their enactment.    Furthermore, due to a number of socio economic changes, policy changes,
and political changes, enactment and review of the existing health legislation is apparent.

3   Health Sector Strategic Framework
3.1      Introduction

The MOHSW has developed a framework to reform the health sector in order to improve the
impact of health services at all levels in the country. The emphasis of the strategic health plan
is on Council Health Services, where most of the essential health services are provided close
to the communities, and on hospital services to save lives of people who cannot be treated in
first line health facilities. The thrust is to improve significantly the quality of essential health
services, make  CHMTs,     Council Health  Providers and  Hospital  Management     Boards   more
accountable to the community.

Delegation of authority means that the dispensaries, health centres and hospitals should be
the key actors in the planning process. It also means that they will be held responsible for
implementing what they have planned. The services to improve health status of the people
should be directed towards the following types of services.

Types of services

The following services provide a continuum of care for patients and clients:
·   Health Promotion activities to enhance behaviour change and to ensure that life styles
    of  individuals  are  conducive  to  personal   development    and    environmental   safety.
    Community   participation and  ownership  is key to success of  the   primary  health service
    delivery programme;
·   Preventive  health    services  to prevent   diseases by promoting     optimal nutrition and
    control of infectious diseases transmission, curtail epidemics and improvement of working
    environment to maintain highest standards of occupational health;
·   Care and treatment (curative services) This is to treat correctly diseases or conditions to
    reduce the likelihood of complications or death by improving quality and quantity of care
    to patients and ensuring availability of basic services and supplies;
·   Rehabilitation services to patients such as physical rehabilitation, mental rehabilitation
    and psychological support to vulnerable groups;
·   Provision of services to the chronically ill and the elderly; this includes catering for life
    long  treatment  like hypertension,  diabetes, AIDS   patients on ARVs,    renal conditions,
    Cancer and any other chronic conditions.

The health sector consists of components or levels in the health sector:
·   Council health services (in district or municipality), consisting of:
            o  Household and community health
            o  Dispensaries and Health Centres (public and private)
            o  District Hospital and other hospitals (public and private)
·   Regional health services, consisting of
            o  Regional Referral Hospitals
            o  Regional Health Management Teams
·   National level services, consisting of
            o  Specialised Hospitals and Special Hospitals (public and private)
            o  Training Institutions, Zonal Resources Centres
            o  Ministries, Departments and Agencies

The MOHSW has identified eleven strategies, which the health sector should achieve during
the period of implementation:

·   Strategy 1: District Health Services
·   Strategy 2: Referral Hospital Services
·   Strategy 3: Central Support

 3.2    Dimensions of HSSP III

The HSSP III has four dimensions, i.e. types of services, levels in the health sector, strategies
and crosscutting issues, which each serve as entry point for addressing key strategic choices,
and which together result in one consistent strategic plan.

strategies. In the paragraphs the types of services are explained, where applicable. Chapter 5
elaborates the  crosscutting issues  and  their impact  on  the levels of  the health  sector. In
chapter 6 the strategies are summarised in tabular form. In the tables types of services and
cross-cutting issues are included.
The strategic  plan serves   as reference   document    for developing  specific  hospitals and
Council strategic  plans, and  for annual  work  plans. The   four dimensions    offer reference
information that can be used in further more specific planning.

4   Strategies
This chapter outlines the detailed narrative strategies and important focus areas for the HSSP
III. The implementation plan including strategic objectives and expected results can be found
in chapter 6.

4.1       Strategy 1: District Health Services

Situation Analysis

In recent  years the   Councils  (Local Government       Authorities)  established   and    improved   the
decentralised  health   systems.   At  the Council    level  a    separate  health   sector     account  is
maintained    (account   number    6),  where    earmarked        funding   for  health   is    kept.  The
Comprehensive     Council  Health    Plan  (CCHP)     is a  well-established    tool  for   planning   and
monitoring   health  activities. The    management       structure,    consisting  of    Council   Health
Management     Team     (CHMT)     and  Hospital      Management       Team     (HMT),    facilitates  the
implementation of health services at district level, together with a functional community health
structure (Council Health Services Board and Health Facility Committees).

The financing of District Health Services improved, with increase in Government funding and
Health Basket    funding. Complimentary      financing   options   of the   National  Health    Insurance
Fund (NHIF), Community Health Fund (CHF) and user fees have been introduced to provide
sustainable   sources  of funds   to  bridge  gaps    in the budget    for  health services     provision.
However, bureaucratic procedures, along with the lack of bank accounts at health centre and
dispensaries have hampered the potential use of these funds. Councils hardly use their own
discretionary funds to support health services.

District Health Services still face problems with low geographical coverage of health services
in remote   areas   and a  non-functional    referral system.     The  infrastructure    of some     health
facilities does not meet the official standards. Also policies, standards and guidelines are not
fully used at implementation level. They may not be known or understood by health workers
with little time or access to information about developments in the health sector. Occasionally,
health workers   in peripheral   institutions do not     function  well:  cases  have     been   found  of
unacceptable attitude of health staff and corruption in the health sector. The comprehensive
National Package of Essential Health Interventions therefore cannot be fully provided.

Other  challenges   include  inadequate    managerial      skills of  staff in  various   areas.   CHMT
Supervision of district health facilities needs improvement and supervision from the RHMT to
backstop CHMTs is not optimal. As a result health programmes are not always implemented
as  designed.  The   integration  and  coordination    of  health  programmes      in    general  is  poor.
Programmes    sometimes    seem    to compete   for   attention   from health   facility staff. But,  most
importantly,  there is inadequate    human    resource   for health   service   delivery  at the  primary
level, both in numbers and in skill mix.

Council Management Teams (the district administration) are often not fully informed on health
policies,  programmes,    or  specific    activities,  and   may     therefore   not  appreciate      their
importance. Furthermore, the Decentralisation by Devolution has not reached the grass roots
level, leaving health workers and communities disempowered. Decision making is too a large
extent concentrated in the district centres. Motivation of staff to perform needs to increase to
ensure good performance.

Way forward in district health service provision

      District Health Services Strategies
      1.  Increase  accessibility  to health  services    based   on   equity  and gender     balanced
          needs
      2.  Improve quality of health services

                                                 24
In the strategies of the health sector priority will be given to equitable access to quality health
services for all. The Tanzania Package of Essential Health Interventions will be updated, to
serve as reference guide for service delivery. The MMAM is the major strategy for improving
access   and   expansion      of health    services     in underserved       areas    with one   dispensary       per
village and one health centre per ward. Its implementation is part of this strategic plan and will
involve  the  health    sector   as  a whole.    Public    Private    Partnership     (PPP)   will  be   enhanced
through joint planning, implementation, monitoring and supervision.

Interaction   between      community      and  health   services     to   promote    healthier   lifestyles  will be
intensified.  Community       based  strategies    in   health    promotion,    nutrition, disease    control    and
reproductive health will be used to create more ownership of health in the community. Health
activities will  be     gender   sensitive,     taking     care   of the     special   needs     of  women,      and
incorporating    men    in family-centred     advocacy.     The   integration    of  health  and    social  welfare
services will create synergies, which benefit the poorest, most vulnerable, handicapped and
chronically ill.

The   Tanzania     Quality    Improvement       Framework       (TQIF)     will be   operationalised,     with    the
introduction of an accreditation system, to guarantee defined standards of quality in the health
sector.  Standards      and   protocols   in  service    delivery    will be    promoted   and   updated     where
necessary. Adherence to the Client Service Charter will be further promoted. Improvement of
diagnostic services (including laboratories), curative care, and rehabilitation services will be
achieved through capacity building and provision of necessary resources to health facilities
based on the Essential Health Package. More coherence of service delivery can be achieved
through   integration   of  health   programmes       at   service   delivery   level. Enhanced       collaboration
with other sectors will be required to improve nutrition, water, health education, etc.

The district hospital together with other hospitals in the district will provide first level referral
care, and be fully integrated in the districts health services. A functional referral system will
guarantee     that patients,  in  need    of  advanced      care,    will indeed     receive it. All  facilities  will
function according to their mandated roles, and measures to reduce by-pass of facilities will
enhance efficient use of resources.

Way forward in management of District Health Services

 Management of District Health Services Strategies
 3.   Strengthen and decentralise management of District Health Services and harmonise
      MOHSW and PMO-RALG management procedures

District Health    Services   are the     focus of nearly     all the policies   and   strategies     in the health
sector. Therefore, it is crucial that the capacities for implementation are available at district
and  facility level. Improvement       of  the  management        capacity    of District  Health   Services     and
availability of human resources for health in the periphery are priorities in the HSSP III.

The Councils will develop health strategic plans for the period 2009-2015, following the HSSP
III. The Councils will produce annual Comprehensive Council Health Plans (CCHP), based on
the  inputs   from  health    facilities, which    will plan    for  interventions    based   on    the  prioritised
essential  health   and    nutrition issues,    as well    as burden      of disease   taking    into account     the
available financial means. Further decentralisation within the District Health Services will take
place. Health facilities will produce their own annual plans and will increasingly manage their
own funds, in collaboration with the Health Facility Committees, representing the community.
The management capacity of peripheral health staff for planning, coordination and monitoring
will be  strengthened.      Collaboration     with    the  private   sector     will be   strengthened      through
service agreements.

The   Council    Health    Services    Boards      (CHSB)       and   Health     Facility  Committees       will  be
stimulated    to fulfil their responsibilities     in planning      and   monitoring    of the   health    services
including facilitating the introduction of sound financial and accounting management systems.

                                                        25
In collaboration   with  PMO-RALG       simplified    management     procedures    will  be  developed     for
District Health Services, reducing district bureaucracy. CHMT supervision of health facilities
will focus  on  coaching    based   on  guidelines    and   standards,  and   evidence    based  medicine.
The RHMTs will be given more responsibilities in supporting the District Health Services.

M&E    of  the  District  Health   Services     will be  strengthened,    using   LGA    and   PMO-RALG
procedures     and  systems    within  the  context   of  monitoring   and evaluation     of achievements
towards    MKUKUTA        and     MDG      targets.   Also   the  capacity    for  information     analysis,
dissemination and utilisation will be strengthened with the aim to enhance health managers'
evidence based planning and decision making.

Motivation  is  a cornerstone     for sound    management     in the   human  resource    intensive   health
sector.  A  combination     of supportive   supervision    and performance     based     incentive systems
will be rolled out in the coming years. Pay for performance (P4P) and Results Based Bonuses
(RBB) will be introduced.

4.2       Strategy 2: Referral Hospital Services

Situation Analysis

The Tanzanian health sector has a pyramid structure with provision of referral services from
primary   hospital  to secondary      (regional)  hospital   and  final to tertiary (central)   hospital   or
specialised hospital. The referral health care is not working as planned due to a number of
challenges. There are no referral guidelines and therefore patients at their own discretion can
enter  at a higher   level  of care   than  necessary.    Regional   hospitals are  operating    as   district
hospitals instead of performing their role as further specialised referral hospitals in support of
district hospitals1. The zonal structure for referrals is not operational and the number of highly
specialised hospitals is insufficient. The resources are inadequate, such as skilled staff (e.g.
medical   specialists  in   regional  hospitals),    funds,  medicines   and  supplies,   equipment     and
infrastructure.

With regard to management of hospitals the roles and responsibilities of MOHSW and PMO-
RALG     have   not yet   been    harmonised.     The    Hospital   Boards  are   not    yet in place   and
collaboration between ministries is insufficient. There is too much bureaucracy to access cost
sharing   and  other  health   funds,  which    negatively   affect motivation  of  staff to  collect these
funds.

Way forward in hospital service provision

      Referral Hospital Services Strategies
      1.   Increase access for patients in need of advanced medical care
      2.   Improve quality of clinical services in hospitals

Regional   hospitals   will be   reformed    in order   to  competently    perform  their   referral  role of
handling   cases   requiring   specialised   care,   rather  than   providing primary    health  care.  The
Hospital   Reforms   Programme        will be   taken  forward.   The   Tanzania    Quality   Improvement
Framework      programme     will be  reinforced,    with  a Quality   Assurance    Unit  in  each   referral
hospital. Health workers will be sensitised to follow available standard treatment guidelines. A
hospital accreditation system will be put in place.

The   referral structures   throughout     the sector  (horizontal  and  vertical)  will be  strengthened,
with clear guidelines and protocols. Specialist outreach programmes from tertiary to regional
referral  hospitals  will   be  institutionalised,   contributing   to  technical  supervision     of those

1 To operate as regional hospital a minimum of five specialists is needed (Internal Medicine,
Paediatrics, Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynaecology).

hospitals.  The  zonal     referral structure  will be    endorsed     and  made    operational.      Regional
hospitals will be involved in supervision of district hospitals.

Social welfare services in hospitals will be expanded, to ensure that vulnerable groups get the
care they need. Emergency preparedness and response in hospitals will improve based on a
national programme.

      Referral Hospital Care Objectives,
      3.    Improve management of the hospitals through implementation of Hospital
            Reform Programme
      4.    Strengthen hospital governance

Hospital  management       capacity   building    will continue     in the  coming     period.  The   hospital
reforms programme will be fully implemented. National and regional Hospital Boards will be
created based on a sound legal framework. Community representatives will take part in the
Boards.   Inter-ministerial   consultations    between     MOHSW        and    PMO-RALG      will  clarify  the
division of roles and responsibilities particularly between the technical and the administrative
functions  of   all stakeholders     in  hospital  management          (including  the  role  of   community
representatives).

Referral  hospitals   will be  encouraged      to introduce    and     maintain   financial and    accounting
management software systems. Hospitals will generate additional income from services and
will engage in relations with health insurance schemes. The hospitals will develop strategic
plans for  the  period    2009-2015,    following the   HSSP    III and    will produce  annual     plans  and
budgets.   Hospital    capital   investments    and     maintenance       will  be  planned     to  bring   the
infrastructure up to standard.

4.3      Strategy 3: Central Level Support

Situation analysis central level

Central  level  support   to  health service   providers   is  given   by  the  MOHSW     headquarters,     its
departments and by several agencies and institutions operating under direct responsibility of
headquarters. Medical Stores Department (MSD), Tanzania Food and Drug Authority (TFDA),
Tanzania   Food     and   Nutrition Centre,  National     Institute for  Medical   Research,    Government
Chemical    Laboratory     Agency     and   Health     Regulatory      Authorities  provide    indispensable
services to the health facilities and health professions.

The health    sector   in Tanzania    is  extensive    both in  scope    and    geographic   coverage.     The
performance of central level support plays a key role in the effective delivery of health care
services   by   Councils   and   programmes.        Quite   often   the    quality of  service     delivery  is
compromised     by    delayed    delivery   of    resources    e.g.    funds,    medicines   and      supplies,
equipment, shortage of skilled staff or means of transport.

Bureaucratic    red  tape,   over-centralised   or  delayed    decision     making   can  be    the   cause of
delays.  The   use  of  outdated    rules and  regulations    can   be  a  contributing  factor.   Developed
policies  and   plans     are sometimes     not   implemented,         and  the   enforcement      of existing
regulations  is not   always   taking   place. This    results in   a  gap  between    theory   and   practice.
Collaboration   between      key players   and    stakeholders      in the  health  sector   is  not  optimal.
Interaction   between      the   MOHSW,        PMO-RALG        and      the    Private  sector     concerning
programmes is insufficient.      The decentralisation is not yet fully internalised by the system.
Supervision or quality control is not systematically done. Central level managers too often are
involved in running basic operations instead of strategic decision-making.

                                                       27
In   recent  years,  new    health   legislation  has  been      enacted,     but there     is still limited
understanding of the holistic nature of health legislation. This has affected the implementation
by other stakeholders. Similarly, laws are not self executing instruments; hence they require
implementation support to ensure effective enforcement. Furthermore, there are a number of
health  related  international conventions/agreements       initiated by   other  sectors    and   partners,
which need to be adopted and implemented.

Way forward headquarters

      Central Support Objectives, Head quarters

      1.    Enhance decentralisation of MoHSW headquarters
      2.    Strengthen governance in the MoHSW
      3.    Strengthen the operational planning process of MoHSW headquarters
      4.    Institutionalise traditional and alternative health practice in the established health
            sector

During the strategic plan period the health sector will attain the required institutional capacity
and organisation structure necessary in the decentralisation framework. Operational decisions
will be left to  PMO-RALG,     the  LGAs,    and  where    possible  to  the  health   facilities. This   will
enable headquarters to concentrate on stewardship functions, rather than operational issues.
These strengthened stewardship functions will include strengthening multi-sector coordination
and   collaboration   on   health   related  issues.  MOHSW         will promote      harmonisation     and
alignment    of sector   financing,  policy  and  planning.    Where     necessary,    the   MOHSW        will
develop   new    policies,  legislation and    operational  guidelines,    and    revisit  old    ones. The
MOHSW will improve its performance as custodian of health related legislation. The MOHSW
will formulate  a  Health  Legislation  Implementation     Support   Plan,  which     will outline   different
activities to be carried out, including dissemination, enforcement, monitoring and evaluation of
legislation. MOHSW will work towards further institutionalization of Traditional and Alternative
Health Practice as stipulated in the National Health Policy. PMO-RALG will be main partner in
this, as supervisor of LGAs.

Coherence    between     policies, legislation  and plans   will be   high  on    the agenda.     A  gender
sensitive    and   human    rights-based     governance      system      that  ensures      accountability,
transparency and adherence to leadership ethics is another output expected during the HSSP
III period.

Improvement     of the  planning   process   in the Ministry   will take  place,   leading     to integrated
operational plans for support services to programmes, departments, regions and districts. The
MTEF    planning   will be  comprehensive,     more  than   annotated    budgets.     Workable     plans  for
MDAs    will be  formulated    to  enhance   the  support   system.      Improved   coordination     will be
achieved    by  integrating support  services    provided   by programmes,        department      and units.
Uncoordinated     and   unplanned   activities,  disrupting  the  implementation      of   CCHPs     will be
halted.

The agencies and institutions operating under direct responsibility of MOHSW will implement
their specific strategic plans according to delegation by MOHSW, contributing to reaching the
health sector goals. The ministry will support specialised hospitals, regional hospitals, Zonal
Resources    Centres    and other   training institutions, as  well as   Councils   to develop     strategic
plans for the period 2009-2015, following the HSSP III. The Comprehensive Council Health
Plan (CCHP) guidelines will be updated from time to time.

Improvement of monitoring and evaluation is discussed below (strategy 11).

Situation analysis Regional Level

The regional level takes up an intermediate position as arms of the central ministries in the
organisational structure of the health care system in Tanzania. The Local Authorities Act and
the decentralisation framework have exhaustively defined the roles and functions at the local

                                                  28
authorities'  level, but   have  inadequately     defined  the roles  and   functions at  the  Regional
Secretariat.

The regional level performs merely administrative supervision of District Health Services as
part of PMO-RALG, rather than technical supervision on behalf of the MOHSW. The role of
the RHMT in quality improvement of district plans and reports is limited. Only administrative
verification  takes     place after  submission     of   plans and    reports. The    Regional   Health
Management Teams (RHMT), including the regional hospitals, are not only understaffed, but
also lack the finances and equipment to discharge their functions.

Way forward regional level

     Central Support Services Objectives, Regional Level

     5. Strengthen the Regional Health Management Team (RHMT) in supervision and
        support of the health service delivery

The Regional Secretariat is strategically positioned to assist the centre in its supervisory and
technical   support  role. The   main   focus  is to have   a  regional health  structure that has  the
capacity to provide both managerial and technical support. First the RHMTs will be internally
strengthened.   The     competency     of RHMT     members     will be  created   to interpret policies,
regulations and conduct supportive supervision. Funding, equipment and means of transport
will be made available to the teams. The MOHSW HQ will provide technical support to the
RHMTs.

The  recognition   of   RHMTs    as regional  officials, with  a well-defined  relation has now   been
formally done. The RHMTs will function more as coaches and advisers of CHMTs, to boost
the capacities of District Health Services in meeting defined quality standards. Social welfare
will be incorporated into the RHMT functions. Coordination with other regional departments,
e.g. water, agriculture, education, will be improved in the context of the MKUKUTA monitoring
activities.

4.4     Strategy 4: Human Resources for Health

Situation Analysis

Health  care   is and    always   will be  a  labour-intensive   sector. Certainly   in a country  like
Tanzania, with a wide-spread population, delivering services to the population requires many
health workers in health facilities, from dispensary level to tertiary hospital level. The health
sector is understaffed. The total of staffing in the health sector stands at 35% of the actual
need  according      to defined  staffing  norms.    The   available  number   of professional   health
workers in the public sector is 35,202 and deficit is 90,722. Shortages in the private sector,
especially in FBO institutions are also immense.

There is an enormous shortage of human resources for health across all cadres: clinicians,
nurses, pharmaceutical      technicians,   laboratory  technicians,  radiographers,   physiotherapists,
health officers and health administration cadres. The shortage is more severe in rural districts.
The high attrition rate is a threat and is compounded by HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The  policies  and   regulations  with  regard  to human    resources   for health   depend to  a large
extent on other ministries (e.g. PMO-RALG, POPSM), especially for civil servants. In the past
the MOHSW was not always able to sufficiently advocate for increase of personnel or even to
halt reductions.  Partly   this was  due   to insufficient planning  capacity  to make   predictions of
staff needs. But financial constraints in Government were a major contributing factor to the
shortages. The decentralisation to LGAs affected the employment of health workers and the
Ministry was not able to respond to these changes.

                                                   29
The   collaboration    between     the   public  sector   and  private sector   was  not   always  optimal;   at
times there was competition for the few staff available. Inappropriate planning of new facilities
and services sometimes resulted in under-utilisation of infrastructure and staff.

The   capacity    of health  training    institutions  is limited. Consequently     there  is a  low output   of
trained health personnel. Training institutions have several setbacks (understaffing, neglected
infrastructure) to match the existing demand. Staff currently in the field requires reliable and
accessible Continuing Professional Development to meet training needs, but capacity building
of staff is  often   fragmented,     linked   to vertical    programmes,    not targeting   the   right cadres.
There   is little follow-up    to ensure   that    health  workers    indeed use    the acquired    skills. The
impact of such capacity building is limited. The Zonal Resources Centres (ZRCs) still lack the
capacity to effectively support the training institutions.

Way forward

      HRH Strategies
      1.    Develop policies and regulations on human resources for health & social welfare,
            coherent with government policies
      2.    Strengthen HRH planning
      3.    Maximise effective utilisation of HRH
      4.    Increase production and improve quality of training (pre-service, in-service and
            continuous education) with support of ZRCs
      5.    Improve use of Human Resource for Health applied research for planning and
            advocacy.

The Human Resource for Health Strategic (HRH) Plan 2008-2013 has been formulated and
agreed upon.
Improvement of the human resources situation is priority number one for the health sector in
Tanzania. It must be a well-concerted joint effort of the Public Service Management, Ministry
of Finance, PMO-RALG the MOHSW and other stakeholders.
The MOHSW will achieve more coherence in policies on Human Resource for Health & Social
Welfare    by entering   into  dialogue    with    other  Ministries, Departments    and   Agencies,     and  by
increasing    the lobby  for   better  remuneration,      conditions   of service  and  career   development
opportunities. The leadership in the Ministry will be strengthened to implement those tasks.

The planning and management capacity for human resources will be improved at all levels,
based    on   an     effective    and    a  comprehensive         human    resource     information     system.
Collaboration between public and private sectors will be improved, to come to joint planning of
staffing needs,      and to   improve     rational  use   of available    resources.  Sufficient  financing    is
crucial  for  the improvement       of   staffing. Besides    the  regular government      funding  innovative
financing    methods     will  be    introduced,    e.g.   basket    financing,    project funding,     external
sponsoring.

In collaboration with LGAs the human resources management in management teams in the
districts and health facilities will improve, with better trained HR managers, who can improve
working conditions and productivity of the workforce. Incentive structures for health workers
will be  implemented      to   improve    performance      and  motivation   of existing   health  workers.    A
performance based management system (P4P) will be introduced to that effect. This also will
enhance    the    retention  of   staff.  LGAs   will  play  a bigger   role in  selection    of students   and
provision of scholarships. They will be able to make bonding contracts with the graduates.

The production of new staff through training will increase further to meet the demands. Key
human    resource      production     targets    have     been  set   and  will be   captured     through     the
strengthened      HRIS,  for   both  clinical and   non-clinical   personnel    in the  health   sector. At   the
same    time   the     quality  of  training    (pre-service,   in-service   and    continuing    professional
development)      will improve    at  all levels   for both   public  and  private  sector. Curricula    will be
regularly updated, linked to developments in science and technology. The existing system of
accreditation of training institutions through the National Accreditation Council for Technical
Education     (NACTE)       will   be    strengthened      including   a   development      and    succession

                                                          30
programme     for teaching    staff.   It is important     to create a  system    of recruitment   of  staff,
immediately     after graduation,   without    bureaucratic    delays   in employment     and  payment   of
salaries.

Zonal   Resources     Centres  will  be   strengthened     to  support training  institutions in setting up
quality assurance     in education,    and   to assist   regions  and  districts in  continuing  education.
Vertical programmes will improve collaboration, and will incorporate their training activities in
CCHPs and MTEF plans. They will work through ZRCs in activities of continuing professional
development.

Follow-up and coaching will become integrated part of on-the-job training. Opportunities in the
private health sector will be used where possible. HRH training can be boosted by utilising the
already existing private facilities for training, as well as encouraging investment in the area by
the private sector. Research into human resources issues will be used better to direct plans
and actions for improvement of HRH.

Professional Councils, associations and organisations, as well as other non-state actors, will
be supported to play their role in the improvement of the HRH situation in the country.

4.5       Strategy 5: Health Care Financing

Situation analysis

During the implementation of the Health Sector Strategic Plan II (2003-2008) emphasis was
on targeting resources to the priority interventions. Moreover, implementation of cost sharing
in  Government    health   facilities, through    the Community      Health  Funds   (CHF)    and  National
Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), was implemented. An exemption and waiver system was also
put in place to cater for the poor and vulnerable groups.

During  this  period   the health   sector   has  registered    an increase   of public  health  per  capita
spending from US$ 5.8 in 2004 to US$ 9.0 in 2007. However, on-budget actual health sector
expenditure as a proportion of GDP has remained stagnant (at less than 3%). The increase in
the financial resources to the health sector in absolute terms during the period of HSSP II was
largely due to additional donor support. Often this donor support had little flexibility, making it
impossible to fund priorities, defined in HSSP II. The financial picture is also marked by large
amount    of funds    from Global   Health    Initiatives, which   are off-budget.   The  government    has
little discretion power over these types of funding.

The  gap  between     approved   estimates      and  actual   expenditures   in  general  has  gone   down,
leading to better budget performance, although there is a noticeable gap between approved
estimates and expenditure in the area of HIV/AIDS.

All Councils    have   adopted  the    District   Health   Accounts    tools developed    by  the  National
Package   of    Essential  Health   Interventions     in Tanzania,     which  outlines  the   cost effective
interventions, and the PlanRep for LGA planning and reporting. The allocation to the hospitals
compared     to the   primary health   facilities is disproportionate,   indicating  that people   in urban
areas have more than their share of the health expenditures. However, since the introduction
of  the new   Resource     Allocation     Formula  for   the  health basket   and   block grants,   a more
equitable distribution of funds has been realised.

There are increasing health needs and demands that result from increasing disease burden
(communicable     and    non-communicable         diseases)    as  well as   emerging    and   re-emerging
diseases.    Furthermore, the costs for health interventions are going up, for example, the cost
of anti-malaria, antiretroviral and newly introduced vaccines.

                                                      31
Way forward

      Health Financing Strategies
      1.   Reduce the budget gap in the health sector by mobilising adequate and
           sustainable financial resources
      2.   Enhance complementary financing for provision of health services, increasing the
           share in the total health budget to 10% by 2015
      3.   Improve equity of access to health services
      4.   Improve management of complementary funds raised at local level
      5.   Increase efficiency and effectiveness in use of financial resources

The MOHSW is committed to advocate for increased funding for the health sector, meeting
the Abuja targets (15% of Government budget), in order to ensure access to health services,
equity, and    increase  in coverage       of health  promotion,     prevention   and   care.  The  Ministry  in
partnership    with Development       Partners     maintains    the  Health     Basket    Fund,  and   aims   at
increasing the number of partners and amounts pledged in this fund. The MOHSW will also
advocate for more budget flexibility in donor support.

A comprehensive Health Sector Financing Strategy will be developed early in the HSSP III
period to guide further development of the health financing framework, followed by concerted
efforts to implement such a strategy.

Further,   the issue  of  health care      financing   and  the   closely  related  issue   of health   system
organisation   and   governance       will occupy     a  prominent   position    in both   the  overall  health
reform discussion during HSSP III.         An overall policy framework will be developed and used in
the  assessment       of  health   financing       options,   covering    both    revenue     generation     and
expenditure    issues  and   including     but  not   limited to:   (i)  the role of   user fees,   as well   as
exemptions and waivers, and other sources of out-of-pocket payments in the overall health
financing system; (ii) the appropriate role of input versus output-based financing approaches,
including the most appropriate sources of health financing and payment methods for different
types   of health   services;   (iii) the     role of   non-MOHSW         providers    in  the  provision    and
reimbursement     for  services  covered      by   the  government      essential   health  package:   (iv)  the
degree of decentralization to be pursued with respect to MOH health care providers, and any
changes in organizational forms that may result; and (v) policy considerations and priorities to
guide the development of options to address the financing gap.

The  implementation      of cost sharing       and  prepayment       schemes    has    demonstrated    a  great
potential  for raising   additional   revenues     to the  health   sector.  It provides   flexible funding   to
health facilities. The MOHSW prefers improvement of health insurance schemes rather than
increase   of  out-of-pocket    expenditure        by  patients.  It will  also   initiate activities  towards
increasing  coverage     of the social     health  insurance   eventually      reaching   universal coverage.
Regulatory and financing mechanisms will be put in place to enrol the poorest in prepayment
schemes. There is still room for improvements in the management and performance of cost
sharing:   Increase   revenue   (e.g.  in     hospitals) and   reduce     administration    costs Community
involvement    in decision   making        on  spending    of  generated     funds   in   health  facilities will
guarantee   transparency     and   accountability.      The   MOHSW       will  create a   regulatory  body   to
guide and supervise health insurance schemes.

The MOHSW in collaboration with all partners will increase efficiency and effectiveness in the
use of  financial   resources   by  exploring    further   criteria  for resource   allocation   and  targeting
resources to cost effective interventions. To enable this the MOHSW will undertake costing
studies including costing of essential health package, National Health Accounts and Updates
of  Public  Expenditures     Reviews.      Budgeting,      accounting    and    auditing   processes    will  be
strengthened, in coordination with PMO-RALG and MOFEA, leading to transparency in health
care financing.

4.6        Strategy 6: Public Private Partnerships

Situation Analysis
Public Private Partnerships (PPP)2 are in existence in Tanzania since independence. About
40%    of  the   health    facilities are    owned     by   private  sector,   which     include    Faith Based
Organisations       (FBO),  CSOs      and  Private-for-Profit    providers.   In  all districts traditional  and
alternative   health    services    are present.   And    in  nearly all   districts  national  or  international
NGOs are present, working in the health sector. A National Public Private Partnership (PPP)
Steering Committee has been established, and zonal and regional PPP forums are present in
a number of zones and regions. At district level CHSBs, CHPTs and FGCs are in place and
they facilitate PPP collaboration. However, the Ministry has no guiding policy how to put the
PPP concept in practice.

At the end of 2007, the MOHSW, the PMO-RALG, BAKWATA, CSSC and APHFTA finalised
the   national   template    for  the   Service    Agreement      between     the government        and   service
providers in the country and introduction in the districts has started.

In practice, there is general inadequate conceptual recognition and understanding of PPP at
all levels. The private sector is regarded as a separate system co-existing with the public in
provision     of  health     services,     instead   of   one    system      with    equal    actors   providing
complementary services. The capacity of private providers is not exhaustively used, and often
national health programmes are not implemented in private facilities. Therefore clients do not
always have access to life saving medicines or supplies.

The   capacity   of   the  MOHSW,     the  regional    level, the district  and  the   private  stakeholders    in
managing      negotiations   and    contractual   arrangements      in  the  policy   and  Service    Agreement
template is inadequate. There is inadequate mainstreaming of PPP at all levels.

Way forward

       PPP strategies
       1.   Ensure conducive policy and legal environment for operationalisation of the PPP
       2.   Ensure effective operationalisation of PPP
       3.   Enhance PPP in the provision of health and nutrition services

The health policy (June 2007) acknowledges the contribution of the private sector in health
service   provision.    One  of   the   objectives is    increased   participation    of the  private  sector   in
achieving access to health services at all levels.

The   PPP   steering    committee     will propose     a policy, which   will regulate   the   involvement   and
cooperation      of all   health  care    as  well as    commodity      providers,    which    will ensure   that
capacities    in private   institutions   and industry   are  used   to improve      the health  of  the  people.
Issues   of   collaboration  with    the   traditional and    alternative  health    service  providers   will be
strengthened.

It is crucial  that   LGAs,  non-state     health  providers   and   civil society    organisations    and other
relevant    sectors     improve     collaboration,     working   in  a   complementary         way.    Distinctive
competencies of service providers across the sector have to be recognised and incorporated
in CCHPs      and   other   relevant    plans  (e.g.   opportunities   for  horizontal     referral of patients).
There   is no    need   to initiate government     services,   where    private  sector    is already  providing

2 Public Private Partnerships in the health sector can take a variety of forms with differing degrees of
public and    private sector responsibility   and  risk. They  are  characterised    by  the  sharing of  common
objectives,   as well as   risks and  rewards, as  might   be  defined  in a  contract  or manifested   through a
different arrangement, so as to effectively deliver a service or facility to the public. The private sector
consists   of non-state    actors,   e.g.  Non-Governmental      Organisations,   Faith    Based    Organisations,
Community Based Organisations and the private for profit providers.

                                                         33
adequate    services, which    are incorporated      in the  CCHP.   Service     agreements   will provide
mutual  benefit  for Councils   and   private   providers    ensuring   government    programs     are also
delivered   by  private providers  who     are   sufficiently  remunerated.    Private   providers  will be
granted access to government funding on the basis of these Service Agreements.

Private providers will be stimulated to step up service provision to vulnerable groups and in
remote areas. They will be incorporated in insurance schemes, when they meet the standards
for accreditation.   Private   facilities  will  benefit  from   supportive    supervision    by   RHMTs.
Provision of essential medicines through the private sector will be stimulated in a regulatory
way   (e.g. ADDOs).     Private   initiatives   in training   of health   workers    will continue  to   be
promoted.   Partnership    with private    service   sector    and industry    related to  health   will be
explored and strengthened.

4.7     Strategy 7: Maternal, Newborn and Child Health

Situation analysis

Progress has been realised in reduction of under-five mortality, improvement of the nutritional
status  of    children,  and    increased       coverage     of  effective  interventions     (Vitamin    A
supplementation,      exclusive    breast     feeding,    immunization,     IMCI,     improved     malaria
management). Adolescent and newborn interventions have been initiated and the Hepatitis B
vaccine has    been  introduced    in the   immunisation     programme.    But   72%   of  under-fives   are
anaemic, 38% are stunted and 22% are under-weight.

The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) estimated at 578/100,000 live births remains persistently
high. Although   95%    of the pregnant     mothers     attend  ANC services     at least once,  less  than
50% of them deliver in a health facility. Insufficient numbers of health facilities are equipped
and   staffed  according   to  standards     to   provide   emergency     obstetric   care.   There  is  no
functional referral system in many districts, leading to delays in provision of comprehensive
emergency obstetric care. Despite contraceptive prevalence rate has gradually increased to
20% the total fertility rate remain high at 5.7 with an unmet need for family planning at 22%
(DHS 2004).

The   neonatal   mortality   rate  is    32  per   1,000    live  births.  Neonatal    deaths    constitute
approximately   half  the  number     of  infants  who   die  and  this has  not    decreased  in  the   last
decade, leading to concerns of poor peri-natal care in the country.

Despite the    gains and   various  efforts   to  improve   MNCH    service    delivery,  the coverage    of
Maternal,   Newborn,    and Child  Health     (MNCH)     interventions  is still low. There   are  obvious
urban rural disparities as well as significant differentials among the districts. In addition to low
coverage, there is inadequate resource allocation for MNCH services, poor quality of service,
limited access, insufficient community participation, and weak linkages between MNCH and
related programmes.

Way forward

      MNCH Strategies
      1. Increase access to Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) services
      2. Strengthening the health systems to provide quality MNCH and nutrition services

The One Plan for Maternal Newborn and Child Health is the core strategy for improvement of
MNCH, accepted by all stakeholders. The plan will focus on strengthening MNCH advocacy
and communication in the community, using all possible means to reach men, women youth
and   children. The   communities     will  play   a more     important   role in   promotion  of  positive
behaviours and practices for better child and reproductive health.

                                                     34
Increasing  access     to MNCH     interventions   is part   of the MMAM      programme.     Increased
coverage of primary health care in remote areas will provide MNCH closer to the community.
Focus  will be on  increasing    proportion  of skilled  attended   deliveries, providing   Emergency
Obstetric Care (EmOC) and Family Planning. The TPEHI provides guidance on which MNCH
services should be delivered at each level, and increasing the number of health facilities that
can  provide  the appropriate    EPH   will reduce  maternal    and neonatal    mortality. Provision   of
youth-friendly reproductive health services will be promoted and availability of family planning
methods and child health interventions will be increased.

The health system will be strengthened to provide quality MNCH services. The MOHSW will
review regulations, guidelines and standards, and will improve standardised supervision, at all
levels of the health services. This will result in evidence-based interventions at facility level.
Most important is improving the workforce in health facilities, not only in numbers but also in
competencies to provide quality MNCH care. Improving quality of MNCH services is part of
the Tanzania Quality Improvement Framework, and will be implemented in a comprehensive
context across the sector. Linkages with other relevant programmes will be strengthened, so
that health facilities will provide  appropriately    integrated  MNCH   services  and     other related
services. The referral system will be strengthened and the response to obstetric and newborn
emergencies will be improved through better provision of equipments and supplies, as well as
means of communication and transport as appropriate.

The MOHSW aims at increasing resources for MNCH through advocacy with policy makers
and  planners  (also   in LGAs),  as  maternal  and   child  health is dependent   on  so  many     other
factors, besides health care provision (e.g. nutrition, education, access to safe water).

4.8     Strategy 8: Prevention and Control of Communicable
        and Non-Communicable Diseases

Situation analysis

The burden of diseases in Tanzania is high, with communicable diseases still prevailing. But,
increasingly, the  country   is  confronted   with  the  "double  burden   of disease"     due to   Non-
Communicable    Diseases     (NCDs).   HIV/AIDS,    tuberculosis  and  malaria  are  among     the  most
important   infectious diseases   in Tanzania,    and  are  targeted worldwide   for control,    or even
eradication in the case of malaria. For these diseases national strategies and work plans have
been developed, which are under implementation.

In the area of HIV/AIDS voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) and anti-retroviral treatment
(ART) have been intensified in the past years. For malaria, new diagnostics tests and new
medicines were introduced, the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) was stepped-up
and indoor residual spraying (IRS) implemented in selected regions.         For tuberculosis control,
Stop TB Strategy is being implemented in the country with 100% DOTs coverage. This is in
line with the new Global Stop TB Strategy. Funds for combating these diseases are available
from  several  sources.     However,   the  results   of the programmes     are  sub-optimal     due   to
constraints in human resources and weaknesses in health systems.

Unfortunately, the focus on these priority diseases has reduced attention for diseases, which
can  be classified in   Tanzania   as  `neglected'3:   cholera,  helminthiasis,  diarrhoeal  diseases,
plague  and   rabies.  Although   prevalence   of these   diseases  is not high,  they pose    a   public
health threat to the country. There are insufficient capacities to diagnose and handle these
diseases    and   no      funds  for  control   programmes.       Other   diseases    like   trachoma,
onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, rift valley fever, avian influenza, ebola,

3 The WHO classifies as neglected: Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis),
dengue/dengue haemorrhagic fever, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), fascioliasis, human African
trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, neglected zoonoses, onchocerciasis,
schistosomiasis, soil transmitted helminthiasis, trachoma and yaws.

                                                   35
typhoid, trypanosomiasis and relapsing fever are important in certain regions, but insufficiently
tackled. Many of these vector-borne or food- and waterborne diseases could be controlled by
adequate environmental health activities.

The Public Health Bill is going to be presented before the National Assembly in the October-
November 2008 Parliamentary Session. The Environmental Management Act is not yet fully
enforced, as regulations are still being formulated. These acts require adaptations in the work
in  environmental   health.     Threats    from  an    unhealthy    environment,   often   caused   by
inappropriate  human   behaviour,    are   not  always   handled  in  the correct way.   In the  health
sector,  the health    care  waste   management        plan of   2003  was   not  fully implemented.
Capacities of health workers and employees in other sectors are limited. Health threats at the
workplace continue to be unacceptably high.

With  increasing  life expectancy       non-communicable     diseases     (NCD)   and   conditions are
becoming    more  prominent     in  the population:    cancer, cardio-vascular   diseases,  nutritional
disorders,  diabetes   mellitus,   chronic  respiratory  diseases,    renal disease,   and  congenital
abnormalities.  The   number     of injuries or  trauma    due   to accidents  and   other  causes   is
alarmingly high. Dental problems and blindness due to cataract also increase with an aging
population.  All  these     conditions   are    predominantly     physical,  requiring  medical    and
psychosocial interventions. Mental disorders and substance abuse contribute significantly to
the morbidity burden. They contribute significantly to NCD risk factors, such as alcohol and
tobacco dependency and to causation, maintenance and lack of recovery from most physical
illnesses.  Mental   disorders     and   substance     abuse     predominantly  require   behavioural
interventions.  The    MOHSW        has    recently    developed    a  National   Strategy   for   Non
communicable disease.

Way forward in service delivery in disease control

     General strategies for disease prevention and control
      1.   Improve disease surveillance of communicable and non-communicable diseases
      2.   Enhance community participation in health promotion and disease prevention
      3.   Improve disease case management in health facilities through integrated disease
           control activities at health facility level
      4.   Improve home-based treatment and care

The implementation of disease specific strategies and programmes will continue, as defined
in the approved strategic plans. (See list of plans in table 6). Improvement of District Health
Services and hospital services will create better conditions for achieving targets mentioned in
specific programmes.       Guidelines   and  diagnostic    capacity,  drugs  and   supplies  must   be
available at health facilities. It is the strategy of the Ministry to address service improvement
issues in an integrated way. Community involvement and home based care programmes for
chronically ill will be strengthened.

     HIV/AIDS strategies
      1.   Maximise the health sector contribution to HIV prevention
      2.   Accelerate the access and utilisation of HIV/AIDS care and treatment services
      3.   Scale up integrated TB and HIV services
      4.   Scale up STI control

The MOHSW is fully committed to implement that Tanzania National Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS
Framework    2008   ­  2012.    Programmes      for    prevention of  mother   to child  transmission
(PMTCT), for VTC and ART and blood safety will continue and be intensified where needed.
Care  and  treatment   for people   living with HIV/AIDS    will be improved.  HIV/AIDS     work place
policies will be introduced in all health facilities. Improvement of STI services, e.g. in youth-
friendly clinics and condom distribution will take place.

    Malaria strategies

                                                  36
      1.  Implement universal access to malaria interventions, through effective and
          sustainable collaborative efforts.

The National Malaria Medium Term Strategic Plan (2008-2012) aims to rapidly scale up the
level of  coverage     in  the   main  intervention  areas,    by    adapting   cost-effective   sustainable
channels. This plan provides a comprehensive array of activities in diagnosis, treatment and
vector control.

      Tuberculosis and Leprosy strategies
      1.    Expand and mainstream DOTs strategy to the general health system and
            involve FBOs and NGOs in DOTs
      2.    Introduce and implement MDR/XDR ­TB management
      3.    Leprosy elimination prevention of disabilities and social economic
            rehabilitation of people affected by leprosy.

Implementation of Stop TB Strategy will continue, while more attention will be given to scale-
up   of  quality   collaborative   TB/HIV    services.   Management         of  Multi-Drug    Resistant     TB
(MDRTB) will be improved. In leprosy control, efforts will be concerted on targeted leprosy
elimination  in  districts that  have  not  attained    global leprosy    elimination  targets,  maintaining
quality leprosy services and prevention of disabilities.         Health promotion, disease prevention
and control, care and rehabilitation will be integrated further.

      Neglected tropical diseases strategies
      1.    Strengthen surveillance, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neglected tropical
            diseases and other epidemic-prone diseases

      Non-communicable diseases strategies
      1.    Reduce the burden of NCDs, mental disorders and substance abuse through
            health promotion, prevention and treatment of diseases
      2.    Develop NCD MH & SA advocacy and sensitisation programmes

      Environmental health strategies
      1.    Operationalise the Public Health Act (PHA) 2008, and health elements of the
            Environment Management Act (2008)
The Ministry will develop policies, guidelines and protocols for infectious diseases and NCDs.
More    capacities will be   mobilised   to handle   NCDs.     Health    staff will be (re)trained  in  these
areas; supplies and equipment for diagnosis and therapy will be procured. The emphasis will
be   on promotion   of  healthier  lifestyles including   nutrition   and   physical   exercise,  prevention
and protection especially for mental disorders and for the chronic NCDs that share common
risk factors and therefore can be cost-effectively targeted. In collaboration with social welfare
programmes      the  care    for the   chronically  ill and    handicapped      will improve.    Community
participation in disease prevention and control will be important. The ministry will advocate for
effective road safety measures.

The   Public  Health    Bill and   Environment     Management         Law    provide   guidance     in future
developments.      The  ministry  will develop   regulations   based     on these    acts. The   inspectorate
will ensure  enforcement     where     possible. The    ministry    will speed  up   implementation    of   the
health care waste management plan. The reinforcement of the tobacco products act (2003)
will be enhanced, as well as the industrial and consumer chemicals act (2003). Multi-sector-
Partnerships    to promote    environmental    health   and    implement    relevant   programmes      will be
strengthened.    Sanitation    and   hygiene   measures        will be    promoted.    Compliance      will be
stimulated through advocacy and where possible legal action. More research will be carried
out into the actual burden of diseases in Tanzania and into proper intervention strategies.

Way forward in management of disease control programmes

The   Draft National   Environmental     Health, Hygiene    and     Sanitation  Strategy,   will be finalised
and   operationalised.     Integration   of   service    delivery    and    disease    surveillance    at   the

                                                    37
implementation    level   is  important,     offering  comprehensive       services   to  the     population.
Programme managers at district, regional and central level should focus on coherence in their
planning and support. All activities will become part of CCHPs, and no longer run in parallel.
Training will be  linked   to comprehensive      human    resources   development     plans,   abandoning
isolated activities. Comprehensive IEC and advocacy programmes will be implemented in the
communities.

The MOHSW will take the lead at central level in intersectoral collaboration on hygiene and
protection from health hazards. This collaboration will be further developed under the lead of
PMO-RALG at council level. The private sector will be more involved in the disease control
programmes and environmental health activities. The ministry will strongly advocate for
improvement of occupational health in the country.

4.9      Strategy 9: Emergency preparedness and response

Situation analysis

The health sector can be confronted with general disasters (natural or human-made), which
have medical aspects (e.g. road accidents, chemical waste), or can be confronted with typical
health  threats. Due  to   intensive    cross-border   contacts  and  globalisation   those    threats    may
quickly come   to  Tanzania,    for  example     Avian   Flue, SARS     or new   threats   due    to climate
change.
The  Health   Emergency       and  Disaster    Preparedness    and   Response       Unit (HEPRU)       in   the
MOHSW is responsible for preparing for and responding to Emergencies and Disaster at all
levels (Central Government and Local Government). The MOHSW HEPRU collaborates with
the Disaster   Management       Department      under    the Prime  Minister's    Office  and     with  other
stakeholders.

Since the inception of the unit, it has managed to develop an emergency operational plan and
emergency guidelines. Response teams are established at the national, regional and district
level, which  have   come     into action  on  several   occasions.  Health  emergency        preparedness
and response     operations   have   been    facing   challenges  mostly   due   to inadequate     funds    for
operational activities and delay in release of funds for responding to emergencies.

The  regional and    district level do   not   have  a budget  line for emergency     preparedness        and
response. For the same reasons it has been difficult to train adequate staff at all levels. At this
moment, they are not able to handle any substantial disaster autonomously. The information
management     system     for  emergency       preparedness    and   response     is not   functional     and
communication is not well coordinated.

Way forward

     Emergency Health strategies
     1.   Establish systems at al levels for immediate emergency response to health
          disasters and disasters leading to health problems

Capacity  building   will take  place    in  emergency      preparedness   and   response      at  all levels
(awareness,    training,   guideline     finalisation  and   dissemination,    protocols      for  response,
communications,     etc.). An      effective surveillance    and  information    system   for     emergency
preparedness     and response      (risk assessment    and   early warning   system)     will be  created    in
coordination  with   other    information      systems   in  the  sector   (e.g. epidemiology)       and     in
coordination with other sectors (e.g. meteorology).
Resources will be mobilised for immediate response, and when necessary funds will be made
available bypassing bureaucratic procedures. The district and regional level will manage the
response   to disasters    with    only  local impact.   National  and  international    networks      will be
developed,    which  monitor    potential    threat,   provide timely   warnings     and  which     evaluate
disasters and responses, in order to learn lessons for the future.

                                                      38
4.10        Strategy 10: Social Welfare and Social Protection

Situation analysis

Social  welfare    concentrates    on  vulnerable   groups      in the society.   The  actual   needs   in  the
country    are  not  yet  fully  mapped.     Presently    social    welfare    is fragmented      and  mostly
institution-based. Social welfare is weak at LGA level; only 56 among 133 councils provide
social welfare services. In Councils and village governments the concepts of social welfare
and   social protection   are often   not   fully understood.      Vulnerable  groups   are    not sufficiently
recognised and risks not identified. In rural areas where most people are active in the informal
sector,   support  to  vulnerable    groups   is  left to  traditional  systems,     which  are    not always
functioning well in catastrophic situations.

There is a shortage of skilled human resources and funds. Currently the department only has
210 welfare officers, compared to the 3,892 needed. Not all districts and regions have social
welfare officers in place. There is not much collaboration between health and social welfare
officers   yet, both  at district  and   at regional   level.   The    private sector  (NGOs       and FBOs)
provides    social   welfare  for  vulnerable     groups,    either  in  institutions  or   in  communities.
Orphans, vulnerable children, people living with HIV/AIDS are targeted for such support. The
M&E of social welfare is weak.
The   draft Social   Welfare  Strategy   has  been     developed     recently,  but  operational   guidelines
have not yet been formulated.

Way forward

      Social Welfare and Protection Objectives
       1.   To operationalise the Social Welfare strategic plan (2008)
       2.   To integrate social welfare and health offices at Regional and Council level
       3.   To ensure gender sensitive socio-economic wellbeing and to establish an efficient
            system for delivery of social welfare services
       4.   To improve social protection in the community

Once the Social Welfare Strategy has been approved, implementation can start. A paradigm
shift must   be    promoted   from    institution-based    social   welfare    to community-based       social
protection. A rights-based approach will be stimulated through employing strategic techniques
where    policies  and   programmes       are     designed   to    reduce  poverty    and   vulnerability   by
promoting    efficient labour   market,   diminishing     people's   exposure     to risks, enhancing    their
capacity to protect themselves against hazards. Gender-sensitivity and equity are important
concepts, which will be promoted. Laws and regulations will be updated; guidelines will be
formulated and disseminated.
Synergies    will be created    in prevention     and  care  for   vulnerable  groups   (e.g.   chronically ill,
HIV/AIDS, disabled people, nutrition). Equally collaboration between health and social welfare
officers will result in better use of the community based insurance system, CHF, rather than
depending on exemption regulations for vulnerable groups.
An  accreditation    system   in  social welfare    will  be developed     and    enforced,    to ensure   that
quality care is provided by all social welfare services, public or private. Increased number of
social welfare officers must be trained and employed to ensure services are delivered in all
districts.

With  regard    to management,       the  incorporation      of social  welfare    officers in    CHMTs    and
RHMTs will create more collaboration. Community activities can be planned jointly, and health
facilities can play a bigger role in protection of vulnerable groups. Also integration of Social
Welfare    into the  Health   Monitoring    and   Evaluation    system    will be  advantageous      for both
sides.

Intersectoral   collaboration   will be  strengthened     and    strategic alliances   at   all levels will be
made,     with  e.g.  private   sector   and  NGOs       for protection    of  vulnerable    groups.    Close
collaboration with charity organisations will result in better coverage of services.

                                                       39
4.11      Strategy 11: Monitoring, Evaluation and Research

Situation analysis

The M&E system in health in Tanzania consists of routine systems (HMIS, demographic and
disease surveillance) and non-routine systems (household surveys, research). The MOHSW
is in charge   of HMIS     and   disease  surveillance,    while non-routine  information   systems  are
often done by other government or research entities. Tanzania can provide overall information
of reasonable     quality  on  the health  status   of the   population,  on  diseases   and  on  health
services  provision.   The    information is  not only  relevant   for the   health sector, but also for
Government as part of the MKUKUTA and MDG monitoring. Development Partners and other
stakeholders have great interest as part of the accountability for funds.

In the collection of data in routine systems (HMIS), there are weaknesses: data from health
facilities are not always complete or not reliable. Often data collection is delayed. Feedback to
collecting facilities, particularly  from  the    district level is  practically nonexistent.   FBOs  in
general comply with national information systems, but private-for-profit facilities often do not
provide any information. Disease surveillance is improving steadily, but still meeting reporting
delays. The registration of vital events (births, deaths) does not have a good coverage, while
this information is required for planning health services.
The reporting system through LGAs, PMO-RALG and MOFEA (in the context of MKUKUTA)
operates   parallel to    information  systems    within    the  sector. The   quarterly  technical and
financial progress  reports    do  not have   any function   in  the monitoring   by the  MOHSW.    The
Councils   are supposed       to report   on  the 20   CCHP      indicators  annually.   However,   most
Councils cannot provide the information partly because the indicators are not well-elaborated.

Operational  research      is under-funded,    while   the   census  has    gaps  in  terms  of detailed
information, and research findings most often only shared in international journals without any
feedback to policymaking level.

More problematic is that data are not analysed, organised or presented in a user-friendly way.
Interpretation is difficult and therefore there is limited use of data for local planning, starting
from the collecting facilities to the CHMTs. As a result, resources are not always allocated to
where they would be needed most.
MOHSW      programmes      have    de-linked   from the    HMIS   and    set up  their own   information
system. These systems operate in parallel and do not share information and expertise. There
is an over-reliance on programme-driven surveys and surveillance systems, and information
from  those  surveys    is not   sufficiently shared.  Existing   administrative    data on finances  or
human resources are not used within MOHSW, while separate databases are being created.

Human resources are inadequately skilled in all steps of the information cycle (data collection,
processing,  analysis,    epidemiology,    research    etc.) and    do not   know   how  to use  routine
information in planning and performance appraisal.            Peripheral staff are not really aware of
what they could do, or should be doing, with data.         MOHSW has problems keeping skilled ICT
staffs who are attracted to the "greener pastures" in the private sector.           Funding for M&E is
insufficient to meet the demands from different stakeholders.

The way forward

      Monitoring and Evaluation strategies
       1.  To develop a comprehensive M&E and Research Strategy for the health and social
           welfare sector
       2.  Strengthen integrated systems for disease surveillance
       3.  Strengthen integrated routine HMIS
       4.  Introduce data aggregation and sharing systems based on ICT
       5.  Enhance surveys and operational research

M&E needs to be strengthened in order to achieve evidence-based planning, and to establish
transparent accountability. The MOHSW will develop an M&E policy and strategic plan that

                                                    40
spells out  roles  and   responsibilities  of all actors     at all levels.   Besides   the   health facilities,
CHMTs, RHMTs and MOHSW, also LGAs, PMO-RALG, and MOFEA have an interest in M&E
in health, as reporting on health services is incorporated in local government monitoring and
in MKUKUTA monitoring. Collaboration in this field is therefore mandatory.

A first priority for strengthening M&E in health is the formulation of a Health Sector Monitoring
Framework,     satisfying  the information    needs    of all   stakeholders,    with  a harmonised    set  of
indicators, data elements and data sources (routine and non-routine).

The HMIS will be reviewed and strengthened to improve the data flow and analysis, and to
integrate related systems (performance appraisal, programme monitoring, etc.). Participation
in HMIS   will become     part  of accreditation   of   health    facilities. The  volume     of routine data
collected at facility level needs to be streamlined and data collection simplified. Existing tools
will be refined at all levels. Where possible, automation of data aggregation and analysis will
be   introduced.  A National   Information   and  Communication         Strategy   will  guide   operations in
the  health sector.  Health    facilities and CHMTs       will  be  the  prime    users    of data in routine
operational planning and in formulation of annual CCHPs.

The Council indicators will be brought in line with the HSSP III indicators, and the MOHSW in
conjunction with PMO-RALG will ensure that the annual technical progress reports by LGAs
are fully harmonised with the HMIS and thus get a place in the overall monitoring system.

The   HIR unit needs    to be  strengthened    to  include    capabilities    in epidemiological     analyses;
M&E structures and systems will be given prominence in the Ministry. At the national level,
the  existing  fragmented   databases      need   to   be replaced    by  a    flexible data   warehouse.   A
system   of organising     data  on  morbidity    and   mortality    to  link  up  with    available  data  on
resources   (financial, human,     material and   others)    will be  developed     to  ensure   use  of such
data as a comprehensive package for decision making and planning. This will ensure that all
data is available and well managed, to provide a balance between accessibility and security.
Existing and new data from vertical programmes (HIV/AIDS, Malaria, TB, etc), as well as from
laboratories   and   administrative  databases     (HR,      Finance),   population­based        surveys   and
operational research etc. will also be incorporated into the data warehouse. New technologies
will enable   data   communication     and    exchange       between    stakeholders,      where   and   when
needed.

Appropriate training programmes on data collection and use will be introduced (in-service and
pre-service) to strengthen the health workers' capacity. Regular supportive supervision linked
to information use will be key to in-service capacity development. The M&E system will learn
from well performing programmes (TB, EPI, HIV/AIDS) and adapt tools and models for better
performance of the overall system. Disease and demographic surveillance will continue. More
collaboration between programmes will be created to come to one joint research programme.

4.12      Other important issues:
4.12.1            Capital investments

Situation analysis

The   infrastructure network    of the health  sector     is enormous,    with   more    than  6,000  existing
buildings to be maintained. Most of the buildings are owned by LGAs or the private sector.
Investments    in infrastructure   and equipment       have  been    insufficient, despite    special funding
through   rehabilitation  programmes.      At the  same      time   new  elements       of service   provision
require more space (e.g. emergency obstetric care, VCT). New standards for buildings have
been   developed,    but   most    health   facilities do    not    meet those     standards.      With  new
programmes new equipment is required, e.g. laboratory or operation theatre equipment.

Huge investments in infrastructure and equipment are needed to cover unmet needs of the
population. In the MMAM an investment programme has been developed, but implementation

                                                     41
will take time due to financial and human resource constraints. The programme is dependent
on collaboration of LGAs and private sector to renovate and create infrastructure. There are
also community initiatives to create infrastructure. Therefore, duplication of efforts should be
avoided,  and   priorities  must   be formulated       jointly. Besides    construction    for health  facilities,
construction of training institutions, offices and staff houses is needed.

The  transport  system      is the  nerve    of  the   system      in the health    sector. This  includes    the
ambulances for patients and the supervision vehicles for the provision of medicines, supplies
and  managerial   purposes.       The transport      maintenance       system    is poor  and   inadequate    for
vehicles and medical equipment.

Way forward

     Capital investment objectives
      1.  To maintain and improve the existing health infrastructure, equipment and means
          of transport to meet the demands for service delivery
      2.  Expand the health infrastructure network based on the MMAM

Expansion of infrastructure is planned, with priority for underserved rural areas. A strategy for
maintenance   and     replacement    of   vehicles   will be    developed.    Innovative   approaches    will be
developed to increase the private sector and community contribution to service delivery within
the context of the MMAM. A new health infrastructure window under the Local Government
Capital Development Grant has been created to ensure earmarking of funds for rehabilitation
of health facilities.
The Ministry will develop guidelines and the CHMTs will engage in programmes of preventive
maintenance, and will ensure that through better care for equipment and means of transport
their lifespan is extended.

The  MOHSW      head     quarters    will continue     to update      quality   standards   and  will build   the
capacity  of owners      of infrastructure    (government       and    private)  to build  in  compliance   with
those standards. The Ministry (through the RHMTs and zonal maintenance workshops) will
also improve   technical    assistance    in  procurement       and   maintenance     of  equipment   to   LGAs.
Repair of equipment will be offered in zonal workshops. Capacity building of CHMTs will take
place to introduce a system of preventive maintenance. More supervision will take place to
enhance adherence to maintenance protocols.

4.12.2          Medicines and supplies

Situation analysis

Overall,  there has      been  an   improvement        in the   supply    of  pharmaceuticals    and   medical
supplies  in public   health    facilities.  But still  too often     these   facilities face  shortages.   The
disbursement of funds for medicines and supplies has been irregular and less than pledged in
budget   allocation.  Capacity    to  forecast   and    quantify      needs  in public   health facilities at all
levels is low. Storage conditions in some health facilities are poor.

Shortage  of  qualified   pharmaceutical       staff is   critical in  both  the public   and  private sectors.
Irrational use of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies remains a challenge. The inadequate
transport system      at district level   is affecting  peripheral     distribution  of  pharmaceuticals    and
medicines supplies as well as supervision.

The National Drug Policy of 1991 has been revised, but not yet implemented. The MOHSW
has drafted essential lists of medical supplies, according to health service packages delivered
by different levels of health facilities, and treatment guidelines have been produced. Health
facility staff have not yet received the new information.

                                                       42
The Medical Stores Department faces shortages of human resources and is overloaded with
logistics for parallel  programmes.        It faces  warehouse      and  storage  management      problems,
especially in the zonal stores. Its fleet for distribution of medicines to districts is aging. The
Logistics Management Information System is weak.

Substandard     and  counterfeit    pharmaceuticals,       cosmetics,    medical  supplies, traditional  and
alternative medicines circulating in the market bring health threats to the population. In rural
areas  there  are   few or no     private  sources   of  pharmaceuticals     and  medical   supplies, which
meet  quality   standards.  Affordability     of pharmaceuticals     and   medical  supplies   especially to
the poor  and   vulnerable  groups      is a  challenge.   Roll  out of  the Accredited   Drug   Dispensing
Outlets (ADDOs) across the country in all the regions has been slow due to the huge costs
involved.

The  capacity   of  the local  pharmaceutical       industry  is low  and  accounts   for only  30%   of  the
national requirements.

Way forward

     Pharmaceuticals strategies
      1.   To ensure accessibility at all levels of safe, efficacious pharmaceuticals, medical
           supplies and equipment
      2.   Strengthen control of quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, medical
           supplies, medical equipment
      3.   Ensure gender sensitive, equitable availability and rational use of quality
           pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment in health facilities
      4.   Enhance harmonisation and coordination and information management of
           procurement, stocking and distribution of medicines and supplies for specific
           health programmes

The MOHSW will prioritise the adequate and timely disbursement of financial resources for
provision  of   essential  medicines,      medical   supplies,   equipment    and  vaccines    at all levels
according    to the  drug  allocation      formula   in  place.  It will ensure   constant  and   adequate
availability of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment of acceptable quality in the
supply chain system for public health facilities and accredited private facilities. The national
medicine policy will be finalized, implemented and monitored on a regular basis.

As part of the HRH strategy more pharmaceutical personnel will be trained and recruited. The
pharmacy council will ensure the provision of quality and efficient pharmaceutical services in
the public   and  private  sectors.    Rational    drug  prescription   and  dispensing   will be promoted
through introduction of up-to-date standard treatment guidelines and dispensing guidelines. In
hospitals    Drugs   and   Therapeutic        Committees      will  be   introduced   as  part    of  quality
improvement.     The    essential   drugs     list will be  regularly    reviewed  and    adapted    to  new
treatment insights as well as distributed to health workers on time. Donors will be stimulated
to comply with the Tanzanian procurement and donation systems, rather than providing non-
requested drugs in kind. The roll out of the ADDO scheme towards improving medicine quality
and access to medicine supply, particularly in rural areas will continue.

MSD will decentralise part of its functions to the zonal stores, which will be able to respond
quicker   to client needs.     It will automate     more   of its   stores management,      making    on-line
information available for clients. Monitoring, evaluation and operational research in medicines
supply  and   utilization will improve,    using    good   management      practices which  should,   where
practical, include the use of ICT solutions
Hospitals and District Health Services will be able to use generated funds more flexible and
procure approved medicines and supplies where available.

The  government,     through      TFDA,    will  step   up  control  of  quality, safety  and    efficacy of
pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, medical equipment, traditional and alternative medicines
in both public and private sectors. Domestic production of pharmaceuticals and establishment
of private outlets in rural areas will be promoted.

                                                        43
4.12.3            ICT in health

Situation analysis

The use of information and communication technology is quickly spreading. Also in the health
sector in    Tanzania   computers   are   common.    Presently   the  main  use   is for information
aggregation   and   analysis,   and  for  data   processing.  In  LGAs   automated     planning  and
accounting systems are applied, also for District Health Services. Gradually access to internet
is created    for CHMTs      and   hospitals. However,    the  systems   are   weakened     by  poor
maintenance of computers and network infrastructures, as well as invasion of viruses. There
is no good storage and back-up policy leading to loss of critical information. Opportunities for
web-based communication and collaboration are insufficiently used.

Way forward

                                            ICT Objectives
      1.  Produce ICT strategy to make use of technology
      2.  Expand country wide information network at national, regional and district level

The  MOHSW        realises clearly that ICTs  have   a positive  impact  on health   care  if applied
effectively.  Therefore     the  Ministry   will  formulate   an  ICT   strategic    framework   and
implementation     plan (as   part  of  the M&E    strategy). It will outline the    way  forward  in
automation and integration of information systems and also develop a data warehousing tool
for data mining, in use of web-based communications in the health sector and information for
the general public (websites). Furthermore, telemedicine to improve diagnosis and enhance
patient care will be initiated. In the Continuing Professional Development of health workers e-
learning will be introduced gradually. Experiences from other ministries (e.g. PMO-RALG) and
the private sector will be used to jump-start the development and to enhance exchange and
sharing of information.

The MOHSW will provide clear directions for data collection, storage and security. Capacity
building in ICT will take place, as part of introduction of programmes.

                                                  44
5   Crosscutting issues and levels in the health sector
For  each    of the crosscutting   issues,     the concepts,     approach,     implementation    mechanisms
and activities per level in the health sector are listed.

5.1     Quality

Concept of quality

Quality   in health   services   means       working    according   to  specific    standards,  which   aim  at
improving    the  health  status     of  individuals     and   communities,      reducing   suffering   due  to
diseases   and   illnesses, and   increasing      clients'  satisfaction.  At  the  same   time  effectiveness
and  efficiency  is increased.    In all  activities   in  the health   sector  the  focus  on  quality will be
enhanced and centred on evidence-based medicine and public health and rational decision
making.

Approach to quality improvement

Quality improvement is an iterative process that never stops. Even in a resource-constrained
environment,     quality should   be    a    priority. Over   the  last decade,     mechanisms     have   been
developed     worldwide,    which    translate    general      quality  concepts    into tangible   tools and
interventions in the area of clinical medicine, public health and management.

The   MOHSW       has    developed      policies,  strategies,     work    plans   and   manuals   for  quality
improvement,     both  general   as  well     as  disease     specific. Standard    Operational    Procedures
(SOP), Treatment Guidelines (TG) and standards are available or under development. During
the  implementation      of    HSSP     III, the   emphasis      will   be  on   putting   developed    quality
improvement      systems  in   place  and     introduce     a quality  culture  in  the  health sector,  which
makes health workers proud and self-confident.

A. Quality of services

The  development      of  an   accreditation     system     for all   service  providers   (government    and
private) and the implementation of the Quality Improvement Framework Programme will make
the quality   improvement      process    concrete     and    transparent.  It will provide   guidance  where
health managers should target specific improvement measures.
All health   workers   and     trainees  in  health    will become      conversant    with the  adherence    to
treatment guidelines based on evidence based medicine.

District:
Accreditation    of facilities and   programmes        for  health  and  social  welfare   will be introduced
gradually, and implementation of Quality Improvement Framework Programme will take place.
Region:
Accreditation of referral hospitals will start, and Quality Assurance Units will be initiated. The
Quality Improvement Framework Programme will be implemented.
The RHMT will take up a coaching role in the Quality Improvement Framework Programme
Central level:
Accreditation of national hospitals will start, and Quality Assurance Units will be initiated. The
Quality Improvement Framework Programme will be implemented.
Training   institutions  are   accredited     by   NACTE,       and    the curriculum    will include   quality
assurance concepts.
In  the Ministry    a regulatory   body      for accreditation    will  be  initiated  and  programmes       will
continue to provide guidance and support for quality improvement.

                                                        45
B. Quality of infrastructure, equipment, medicines and supplies

Quality  will be enhanced     through  standards     and  protocols    for  design of   buildings   and their
maintenance.     The same     applies  for  equipment.    SOPs     for  procurement     of    medicines  and
medical supplies, for distribution and storage, as well as prescription will ensure best use of
resources.

District, Region:
As part  of   registration and  accreditation   all health facilities  will meet  minimum      standards   of
design.   Capacity   building   will take  place    for (preventive)      maintenance      of infrastructure,
equipment, and means of transport. Qualified cadres will effectively manage medicines and
supplies.
Central level
The  Ministries,  Departments    and   Agencies     have  the  task    to provide  updated     and  accurate
standards, and provide resources and support for adherence to the standards.

C. Quality of human resources

Improvement     of  the quality of   human    resources   will be  one    of the priorities   for  the sector
through   improvement       of  the   pre-service    and   in-service      training,  through      continuing
professional   development      and   supervision/coaching        of   health  workers,      combined    with
performance based management. Focus will also be on maintaining health worker discipline
and ethical standards.

District, Region
Continuing    Professional   Development      and   performance    assessment      will be    part of  human
resources    management.     Incentives   for good   performance       of health staff  will  be  introduced,
accompanied      by institutionalised  coaching,     supervision   and     monitoring   mechanisms.      The
RHMTs and regional hospital staff will take up a role in coaching.
Central:
Accreditation and quality improvement of training institutions will take place. Curricula will be
updated, and a system of regular revision, linked to developments in the health sector, will be
introduced.

D. Quality of management

The expansion and decentralisation of health services requires almost every health worker to
take up   managerial    functions.   Through    improvement     of   human    capacities,     introduction of
standardised    operational    procedures     health  workers     will be    capable    of managing     their
institution.  The   information    system     will  focus  on     data-for-decision-making         approach,
automation and countrywide on-line communication.

District
Capacity building of health facility staff in planning, budgeting and management will enable
further decentralisation of the health services. The annual Health Facility Planning will serve
as the basis for Comprehensive Council Health Plan. The revision of the Health Management
Information System will link it closer to decision making. Council Health Services Boards will
be capacitated, to assume their role of community representation in management of services.
Region
Hospital Boards will be created and capacity building of regional hospitals in management will
take place.
RHMTs will be strengthening to take up their crucial role of supervision and support to health
service providers.
Central level
National hospitals will become Autonomous Hospital Boards under the MOHSW.
Pre- and   in-service   institutions will train more    staff for management       functions     and   include
management in the standard curriculum.
Development     of  standard   operating  procedures     and   other   standards   is the  responsibility  of
head quarters in collaboration with other ministries, as well as monitoring and evaluation of
the health sector performance.

                                                    46
5.2    Equity

Concept of equity
Equity in health means a fair distribution of services, whereby all citizens enjoy similar rights
of access, independent of income, gender, religion, geographic location, etc.
In health and social welfare equitable service provision will have priority, giving preference to
those in the society who are most vulnerable and who have the least possibilities to fend for
themselves.

Approach to equity
Despite   efforts  by the Government      of Tanzania    since   independence       to create  an  equitable
society,  more    and more    evidence  is   generated   that   inequity  is  increasing.   In recent  years
mechanisms      have  been    developed,   to   identify poor   and  vulnerable     people  through    social
welfare   offices. Targeted   interventions    have   taken  place.   Resource     allocation  mechanisms
have been developed favouring remote and poor districts. Further strengthening of tools and
practices will get priority. Special attention will be given to creating synergies between social
welfare and health activities in the country.

A. Geographic equity

Remote    rural   areas with  pockets   of poverty    and    ill-health will receive   special  attention  as
outlined in the MMAM (PHSDP), health financing strategies and social welfare strategies.

District:
Health funding mechanisms favouring remote districts will be strengthened. In the programme
of expansion    of health  facilities priority  will be  given  to the   most   remote   and   underserved
areas.
Improvement of staffing level in primary health care facilities in remote rural areas has priority.
Incentives    for  health staff   working    in disadvantaged       areas     will be   put  in  place    and
implementation accelerated.

B. Vulnerable groups' (economic) equity

Access    to health   services  and   social   welfare   for vulnerable      groups  in the  society   is the
commitment of the government at all times.

District, Region:
Health    service  interventions  in  communities     will   concentrate     more   on  tackling   the social
determinants underlying existing health problems (e.g. low education, poverty, exclusion, and
stigmatisation).   Advocacy   for social   inclusion  is an   important   role  for integrated   health   and
social welfare services. Exemption mechanisms for fee payment will be fully operational for
the poorest   and   most  vulnerable   in  society   at  the time  of   need.  Inclusion  of   the poor   and
vulnerable in insurance systems, such as the Community Health Fund through subsidies and
sponsoring    will be   enhanced.    Targeted    actions   will take    place  to  provide   social  welfare
services and social protection to vulnerable groups
Central level
Integration of the work of the Social Welfare Department and the work of health programmes
(e.g. HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, Environmental Health, MNCH) will improve the development of
targeted action plans, assisting the poorest and most vulnerable.

5.3    Gender sensitivity

Concept of gender sensitivity
Gender sensitivity starts from the principle of equality of women and men, addressing specific
service needs of each of the groups. Under the existing socio-economic situation in Tanzania,
women     are more    vulnerable  to  health    threats  than   men.    Women      have  defined   needs   in
reproductive   health:  contraception,  care    during   pregnancy,     delivery   and  post-delivery.  They
also need    more   care  for sexually  transmitted     diseases,  especially    HIV/AIDS,     prevention  of

                                                     47
harmful   practices including female   genital mutilation and  rape.  Often, women    have  special
needs because of their disadvantaged position, not being empowered to exercise their rights
and being exposed to domestic violence. They often have a lower level of education and carry
heavy responsibilities for the care for family and home. The women in general are responsible
for the care of children and elderly.

Approach to gender sensitivity
In policies and strategies gender issues are addressed. Translation into practical measures
has to take place. Health workers are trained in recognising and addressing specific health
problems of women and men. More security and privacy will be offered to clients attending
the health services and confidentiality will be improved. HIV/AIDS and reproductive health will
be priority areas of intervention. Men should be made aware of the special health needs of
women and should take their responsibility in family health affairs.
Gender sensitivity should also be a part of management: to ensure that women are offered
opportunities  for higher  management    positions, and   ensure  that women    are  participating in
decision making bodies, like health facility boards and committees.

Gender and health

The  health  sector addresses   specific gender  related  health  problems.  It addresses  the   girl-
child's health, women's    health  problems    and stimulates  the involvement    of men  in family
health issues (MDG 4, 5, and 6).

District:
Collaboration between social welfare officers and health staff will enhance the gender focus.
Exemption mechanisms for fee paying for pregnant and delivering women are in place and
will be   adhered   to. The  focus  on  reproductive  health   rights  in service delivery  will   be
increased, and there will be special attention on vulnerability of women in HIV/AIDS and STI
and female genital mutilation. Privacy and confidentiality for clients will be guaranteed.
In community health the involvement of men in Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) for
family health will be targeted. The gender balance in management and village committees will
be improved.
Region:
The technical assistance by the RHMT will be focusing on gender issues, with the contribution
of the social welfare department. Gender balance in the team will be addressed
Central level:
The MOHSW will ensure a gender focus in all policy development, guidelines and protocols.
It will prioritise funding of gender sensitive activities, stimulating equality of men and women.
The Ministry will increase the gender balance in management and committees

5.4     Community ownership

Concept
Individuals and families hold the key to maintaining and improving their own health. Healthy
lifestyles reduce the risk of diseases and illnesses. Proper care at home enhances recovery
and reduces risk of complications. Communities and health services have a shared interest in
these matters.

Approach
Individuals,  families  and  communities   are   empowered     to  be  more   pro-active in  health
promotion,   prevention  and  care. Awareness    raising is important, combined    with information
and   education.   Programmes     will incorporate  community     elements.   At  the   same  time,
communities should feel more ownership of health services in their neighbourhood and take
responsibility in the management of the health facilities, in committees or boards.

                                                48
A. Healthy lifestyles

The  change    of   unhealthy    life styles  to a  large  extent    reduces    individual susceptibility to
diseases. Individuals must be empowered to adopt lifestyles favourable to health.

District:
The  health    sector    promotes     empowerment      of  individuals,    families   and  communities    to
improve their life styles and reduce harms from the environment, through Behaviour Change
Communication in communicable and non-communicable diseases. Collaboration with other
governmental and non-governmental stakeholders is crucial in this regard.
Health   facilities will perform  outreach    to the  communities     to   take promotion   and  prevention
close to the family.
Region and Central level
Technical   support     will be  provided    and   programmes    will  include   elements    for community
empowerment in their activities.

B. Care in the family

The  care  for  the  sick    and treatment   of  small ailments  is   the  responsibility  of the family. In
serious   cases  professional     assistance    is required  or  in  cases   where    continuity  of care is
necessary.

District
Collaboration between social welfare officers and health facility staff will improve assistance
to families,  looking    after  patients at  home.    In partnership   with  CBOs      and NGOs    they  will
empower     the families     to  engage   in  adequate     home-based       care. Innovative     approaches
towards social protection will be introduced.

C. Community ­ health services interface

Interactions  between     communities     and   health   service providers    are to   be  strengthened   for
mutual trust building and support.

District:
The  Health   Facility   Committees     will be  strengthen   and    will  execute  their  decision-making
powers in health facilities, especially in decision making on the use of generated funds.
Health    workers   and   Village Health  Committee      members      will work   with Ward   Development
Committees to ensure that health issues are included in Ward development Plans.
The Council Health Services Boards will be strengthened and their roles and responsibilities
as community representatives in decision making will be clarified.

5.5  Coherence in health services planning and
     implementation

Concept of coherence
The  final  beneficiaries     of all  health and    social welfare    services    are  the individuals  and
families.  They     are  best  served  through   a  holistic approach,     when   a coherent     package  of
services is offered, which is linked to improvement of quality of life. Primary health facilities
are small entities, with few staff responsible for comprehensive care. They can function better
if they are trained and if they can work in an integrated way.

Approach to coherence
Creation   of coherence      between    disease    programmes    is   required,  as well   as linkages  with
educational,    nutritional,    and   water   sector     activities.  Fragmentation     will  be   reduced:
Comprehensive       Council    Health  Plans    offer opportunities    for collaboration   and   integration.
With improvement of the quality of the plans, there will be less and less room for unscheduled
activities outside the CCHP.

                                                      49
The  support   from   central  level will concentrate   more   on  coherence,   rather   than  stimulating
fragmentation.   The    joint planning   and implementation    at  Regional   and   Central    level will be
stimulated.  Further     integration  in  training  programmes     of  health   workers     is necessary,
ensuring   that peripheral    health  workers   are  capable  of  addressing  the   health   needs   of   the
communities.

A. Coherence with MKUKUTA and MDGs

Improvement     of   health is put in the  context   of improvement    of the   quality  of life, and  thus
contributing  to growth     and poverty   reduction.   The  GOT    has delegated    this responsibility   to
LGAs as the adequate level for management of delivery of social services.

District:
Intersectoral collaboration for better nutrition, healthier environment, improved education and
social wellbeing will get more emphasis.
Region:
RHMTs will provide technical support to LGAs in collaboration with other sectors in relevant
areas (e.g. water, education, and environment).
Central level:
The  Ministry   will ensure    the integration  of   health in MKUKUTA       planning,   monitoring     and
evaluation and will actively contribute the planning and implementation of the new phase of
MKUKUTA.

B. Coherence of programmes

Coherence of disease control programmes, health programmes and social welfare activities
will create synergies for better results and will enhance efficiency.

District:
The service delivery at facility level will be comprehensive, and provided by the health facility
team.  There    will be  some   level of  specialisation,  but all qualified  staff must    be capable    of
providing essential services.
All health  and    health   related  activities will   be  incorporated  into the   CCHP       and   ad-hoc
unplanned programme activities will be reduced.
Region:
The RHMTs will provide integrated technical support and capacity building.
Central:
Structured and comprehensive annual planning of all activities will take place using the MTEF
methodology, cutting back ad-hoc activities in districts, not incorporated in CCHP. Monitoring
and evaluation of health services will be integrated, moving away from parallel systems. The
SWAp      mechanisms      will  be   maintained    for  improvement    of  coherence      in   support    by
Development Partners.

C. Coherence of capacity building

Integration of training and capacity building activities will lead to improved performance of all
workers in all institutions, and improved career development.

Pre-service training:
Curricula  will be   improved,   covering    relevant   technical  and managerial     areas,   to  prepare
future peripheral health workers on the full range of tasks.
In-service and on-the-job training:
Training will be institutionalised and part of Continuing Professional Development programme
Central level:
Coordination    of   all training   will  take  place   to  avoid  duplication   and     insufficient  time
management.      Zonal   Resources    Centres   will make   a  contribution  to integration    and   quality
improvement of capacity building.

5.6  Complementarity in Governance

Concept of complementarity
Stakeholders in health have distinct competencies, which have to be used optimally, avoiding
overlaps, gaps and unnecessary competition. In the health sector the subsidiarity principle will
be guiding ("don't do centrally what can be done in the periphery"). Decision making should
take place as close as possible to the place of service delivery.

Approach to complementarity
Decentralisation   and  partnerships   contribute   to decongestion   of  central government,      and
result in more effective and efficient service delivery. Trust is the main requirement for this.
The institutions,  which    were traditionally in charge,  have  to  trust that  local authorities  or
private   partners can perform   as well that  they would  do. Capacity    building and  support   are
necessary to empower peripheral institutions to take charge. Transparent standard operating
procedures,   management      protocols, performance    assessment    tools, auditing  tools, etc. will
be improved to guide decentralised governance.

A. Complementarity in management

Government's    policy  of  devolution  makes   LGAs    responsible  for implementation    of  health
services, and regions responsible for supervision. The central level provides leadership and
stewardship in the health sector.

District:
Council institutions will take full responsibility for executive tasks in health and social welfare,
applying   LGA  and   PMO-RALG      administrative   procedures,   with technical support  from    the
MOHSW.
Human resources in facilities will be prepared for management functions, to facilitate further
decentralisation.
Region:
RHMTs     concentrate  on   technical support  to improve  quality of the  Council  health services,
without taking over operational responsibilities.
Central level:
MOHSW head quarters will create an enabling environment for the health services, leaving
executive functions to the appropriate stakeholders (in MDAs, LGAs and private sector). The
Ministry will decentralise more executive functions to agencies and institutions under MOHSW

B. Complementarity in Public ­ Private Partnership

Public Private Partnership creates a level playing field for all health service providers, based
on added value of stakeholders and (where appropriate) competition on quality. Making better
use of the distinct competencies of private (non-state) partners will contribute to improvement
of health of the population.

District:
Service agreements between Councils and private (non-state) providers in health and social
welfare will ensure availability of quality services to the population. Private providers with a
service   agreement    will be  given  access   to  public resources,   to funding    through  health
programmes     and   access  to  purchase  medicines    from MSD   when    value  for money   can  be
achieved. Private investments in health services will be stimulated.
Collaboration between public and private providers will be stimulated to make optimal use of
human resources, e.g. in training and supervision, or for applying (para)medical skills.
Region:
The RHMT will provide technical support to all public and private health service providers
Central level:
The MOHSW       will stimulate   coordination  mechanisms     that attract new   public  and   private
partners willing to contribute to the improvement of the nation's health status. It will lead PPP
forum for joint planning and action.

6     HSSP III Implementation
 The strategies (including cross-cutting issues) are presented in tabular format below. The strategic objectives (in the first column) are the same as the ones in
 the way-forward boxes of each strategy. The purpose of the tabular presentation is threefold:
 ·   The tables provide a summary of the text in chapter 4.
 ·   The expected results in the tables provide information on what the health sector wants to achieve in the HSSP III period, and thus helps the Councils,
     Regions and MDAs in the operational planning
 ·   The indicators in the tables can be used in evaluations of programmes and in strategic reviews. The indicators will also be used in the operational
     planning of monitoring.

 The tables present global strategic priorities, which the MOHSW plans to implement during the HSSP III period. In order to keep the overview short, elements
 of programmes have been summarised. In the documents of specific strategies and work plans (see table 6) more details can be found.
 Furthermore, for each health or disease control programmes a coherent set of interventions can be listed: formulation, roll-out, training, resource mobilisation,
 supervision, monitoring and evaluation. In this general strategic document, those details are not reflected under every strategy separately, but summarised
 under general headings.

 For verification of some of the indicators listed below, information from the routine system can be used, while for others data collection has to be carried out
 during the evaluation. Often information is available at local level, but not forwarded to the Ministry. In a number of cases on the spot assessments have to be
 made to verify the indicator. The indicators below also provide guidance of strengthening of the M&E system, planned in the coming time.

7   HSSP Implementation Arrangements for the health
    sector

  7.1     Introduction

The    organisation   responsible   for  implementing      the health   sector   strategic   plan is  complex    and
includes several public institutions, as well as non-government stakeholders as central, regional and
district levels.
The challenge for this composite sector governance system is to achieve high productivity through
effective management.       This  requires   the  transfer  of information     for evidence-based     management
decisions,   and    subsequently     efficient  performance       of  implementation.      The   system     must    be
structured   adequately     to  ensure   that   the  right    information   is  channelled    to  the    appropriate
management level, and appropriate management entity, where efficient management decisions can
be taken.
Management of the health sector requires competent staff, motivated to deliver high quality of work.
The management arrangements must be geared towards efficiency, effectiveness and motivation of
staff.

  7.2     Sector management and administration
7.2.1   MOHSW Head Quarters

The    Ministry  of Health  headquarters     on   behalf of   the  Government      is  responsible   for the overall
stewardship     of  the  health  sector. The    Ministry   is  responsible   for   policy  development,     strategic
planning, resource mobilisation and monitoring and evaluation in the health sector.
Government       provides   the  overall  political  and   policy    guidance      to the  Ministry,  whereby     the
MKUKUTA       programme      provides   the  overall guidance      to development      programmes     in  Tanzania.
Further integration and harmonisation of MOHSW activities with the MKUKUTA management and
monitoring is expected in the coming period.
As result of the Decentralisation by Devolution the Ministry does not have direct responsibilities for
operational service delivery at the LGA level. However, the Ministry provides guidance to service
providers   and     monitors  the quality    of  the  service     delivery. The    Tanzania    Quality   Assurance
Framework, with an accreditation system, will be an important new tool for the Ministry in guiding
the health sector. The technical guidance by the ministry to the service providers is mainly given
through   the   health  programmes,     which   are  based    in  head    quarters.   These  programmes      provide
treatment guidelines, standard operational procedures and contribute to capacity building of service
providers.  In   future  this support   will be   more   integrated    and   coordinated,     in order   to improve
efficiency.
For    resource     mobilisation  the   Ministry   relates     to  Government,        and  produces      budgets    in
collaboration with the MOFEA. Government budgets are approved by Parliament. The Ministry also
closely  collaborates    with  Development     Partners    who    are part  of the    Sector Wide  Approach,     and
other DPs in health. The basket funding is an important source of funding. The Ministry mobilises
resources from the Global Health Initiatives and multi-lateral agencies. Monitoring and evaluation is
important in the Ministry, for reasons of accountability and for planning. In this the Ministry works
closely  with   other  state  agencies   for statistics  and   research.    The    routine information    system    is
managed     in  the ministry,  while non-routine    information    (surveys,   research)   is provided   by  others.
The    information   generated   by  the Ministry    is important     for Government      for determining    budget
allocations,   for  reporting  performance     to Parliament,     as  well  as international   organisations.    It is
necessary    to  attract development     assistance.    Strengthening      the monitoring    and  evaluation   is   an
important part of the strategies under HSSP III.

The    Ministry  has   its annual   planning    cycle   in the    context   of the    Medium     Term  Expenditure
Framework (MTEF), which is applied in all institutions of government. The planning concerns only

                                                         68
those   activities, which    are  directly under  head     quarter's responsibility. The   planning    will be
strengthened, concentrating more on contents and priorities, in addition to financial planning.

7.2.2   Institutions and agencies under MOHSW

Under the Ministry there are semi-autonomous agencies and regulatory bodies, which are assigned
specific tasks: Registrar of Private Hospitals, National Food Control Commission, Optical Council of
Tanzania, Medical Council of Tanganyika, Pharmacy Board, Nurses and Midwives Council, Private
Health Laboratories Board, Health Laboratory Technologists Council, Chief Government Chemist.
Also national hospitals are directly under the MOHSW.

The Medical Stores Department (MSD) is responsible for the procurement, storage and distribution
of  medicines   and   medical     supplies  on behalf  of  the  government.    To  serve   customers    better
improvement of the procurement and further decentralisation of service is planned for the coming
period (see 4.12.2).

The Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority is responsible for the control of quality of food medicines
and other consumables. Further improvement of quality control is necessary to guarantee quality for
the population, especially when more medicines and medical supplies are produced locally.                   The
Tanzania   Food      and  Nutrition  Centre    (TFNC)   is  responsible    for planning    and   coordinating
implementation of food and nutrition programmes, as well as nutrition training and research.                The
National   Institute  for Medical    Research    (NIMR)    is   responsible  for carrying   out,   controlling,
coordinating,  registration,  monitoring,   evaluation and   promoting  of  health research  in  Tanzania.   It
will be involved in developing the information and R&D strategy in the country.

Specialised and special hospitals function under responsibility of the Ministry. Improvement of their
performance, becoming stronger as referral hospital will be aimed for in the coming time. (See 4.2.)
Training institutions for pre-service training of paramedical staff are also directly under the Ministry.
There are 116 training institutions in the country (including private sector institutions.) Eight Zonal
Resources Centres under the Ministry provide Continuing Professional Development and support to
training institutions. Further decentralisation of operational responsibilities is planned. The training
institutions will be strengthened to that effect. (See 4.4.)

7.3      The Role of the Other Actors in Implementing this Strategy
7.3.1   PMO-RALG and LGAs

Local  Government       Authorities are    responsible for  delivering  three  types  of  public services    in
Tanzania   Mainland:     (1) concurrent    functions;  (2) exclusive   local functions;  and   (3) delegated
functions. Concurrent functions are public services which are funded and regulated by the central
government, but for which the provision is devolved by the sector ministries to the local government
level. Health services belong to these concurrent services.

All Councils produce annually a Comprehensive Council Health Plan (CCHP), which incorporates
all activities of   the  District Health   Services,  and   all sources  of   funding  at  the council   level
(government funds, locally generated funds, local donor funds, etc.). The CCHP is produced by the
CHMT, with inputs from the health facilities, the non-state actors and other co-opted members. It is
approved    by   the    Council   Health    Services   Board    (CHSB),   which    consists  of    community
representatives, officers from other departments, and representatives from the private sector. The
final plan is  approved    by  the  Full Council  Meeting.    The  Regional    Secretariat (Regional   Health
Management Team) approves the CCHP and forwards it to national level. The PMO-RALG together
with the MOHSW assesses the CCHPs and gives final approval, before funds can be disbursed to
the LGAs.
In the future, further decentralisation will give more responsibilities to the health facilities to plan and
manage health activities in collaboration with communities and village governments.
The   LGAs     provide   quarterly  technical   and   financial  progress    reports  (including   the health
component) to the respective Regional Administrations, as part of the local government monitoring
system. The Regional Administrations approve the health part of the reports, which are forwarded to

                                                       69
national  level  and  aggregated     by  PMO-RALG.        In the  future  improvement     of the   quality  of the
technical progress reporting of these reports and better utilisation by the MOHSW for monitoring is
planned.

The funds for health services are managed by the Council and kept on a separate account (called
account   no. 6). Funds   for  health   are    released  by  the  MOFEA,      including  funds  from  the   Health
Basket    Fund,  kept in  a  holding    account    at that   ministry.   Funds  generated    through   insurance
schemes    and   cost-sharing  are     kept in  separate    accounts   under   supervision   of the  CHSB.     The
Health Facility Committees with community representatives decide on utilisation of those funds in
their respective health facilities, within guidance provided by the CHSB.

The Regional Administration is part of PMO-RALG and directly supervises the work of the LGAs.
The Regional Medical Officer is an officer of the Regional Administration. The RHMT is located in
the  Regional   Hospital  and  performs     its duties   of  supervision  and   support  to  the   District Health
Services.    The functions   had   been     reduced   as  part of   the  local government    reforms,   but    now
agreement    has  been    reached    that   stronger  technical   support  by   the  RHMTs      on  behalf  of the
MOHSW is mandatory to improve the quality of the health services. During the implementation of
the HSSP III these intentions will be concretised.

7.3.2     Other ministries

The  Prime    Minister's  Office   (PMO)    is the central   office for  government     coordination,   and    also
manages the Regional Administration and Local Government as explained above. It also has the
central office for emergency preparedness, with which the HEPRU in MOHSW works closely. The
Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS) operates as an agency under the PMO, and provides
leadership   for a  National   Multi-sectoral    Response      to HIV    and   AIDS.  It is  also   mandated    to
coordinate and strengthen efforts of all stakeholders involved in the fight against HIV and AIDS. The
NACP works in close collaboration with TACAIDS.

The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs has an important role in disbursement of funds for
health and in accounting for the expenditure. The Ministry provides the annual budget indications,
which are crucial in the planning process. Therefore there is close collaboration with this ministry.
MOFEA transfers funds for health to MOHSW and earmarked funds for health directly to the LGAs,
on request of the MOHSW. Better communication should reduce delays in disbursement of funds.

The  National    Auditing Office    is responsible    for annual    auditing   of accounts   of  all government
entities, including  MDAs    and   LGAs.    On-budget     donor   funding  is  also subject  to auditing    by this
office. Its collaboration is crucial for timely auditing, avoiding delays in disbursement of this funding.
The Poverty Eradication Division, in the Ministry of Planning, Economy and Empowerment (MPEE)
manages the MKUKUTA Secretariat and coordinates the MKUKUTA Monitoring System.

The Ministry of Education is responsible for all education up to university level. The health cadres
with university education qualifications are produced under responsibility of this ministry. Increasing
higher  qualified  health    staff needs    collaboration    from   this ministry.  The   National   Council    for
Technical Education (NACTE) is responsible for registration and accreditation of training institutions
under health. NACTE will play a role in the expansion and quality improvement of training in health.

Other  ministries are  important    for elements   of  the   health programmes,     e.g. Agriculture   and   Food
with respect  to  nutrition, Water   and    Energy  with  respect   to  sanitation  and  water  borne  diseases,
Industries and Trade with respect to international trade agreements, Gender Women and Children
with respect to gender issues and maternal and child health, Justice and Constitutional Affairs with
respect   to health  legislation.  The   Ministry  is  dependent    on   all  these  ministries  to  achieve   the
strategic objectives of HSSP III. The senior management in the Ministry maintains working relations
and   promotes     attention   for     health   related   issues.   Divisions     collaborate    in  programme
implementation.

7.3.3     Private Sector Partners

Private   sector  partners  are  coordinated  by  several   major    umbrella organisations.  The  Christian
Social Service Commission (CSSC) represents a large number of Faith Based Organisations, from
Catholic   and    Protestant   background.  These   organisations     have   health institutions and   health
programmes all over the country. The Association of Private Health Facilities in Tanzania (APHFTA)
represents   a  smaller  number    of private hospitals  and clinics,  mainly  based   in urban  areas. The
National Muslim Council of Tanzania (BAKWATA) coordinates the Islamic health institutions. Some
of the  NGOs,     working   in the health  sector, are   member    of  the Policy   Forum  or  the Tanzania
Association of NGOs (TANGO). There are also NGO coordination mechanisms for specific topics,
e.g. reproductive health, malaria or HIV/AIDS. The level of interaction between the MOHSW and
these umbrella organisations varies.

The    Ministry chairs a PPP    steering  committee,  in which    representatives   from  the private  sector
participate. Private sector partners also participate in other forums in the context of the Sector Wide
Approach.    Increasingly    the  PPP   at Council    level  will determine    the   collaboration  between
government and private sector. The service agreements will regulate collaboration between service
providers and LGAs. Further strengthening of the PPP forums at district level will be realised in the
coming period.

7.4       Co-ordination and management of the SWAp processes
          including sector DPs
7.4.1     SWAP committee and sub-committees

The Sector Wide Approach (SWAp), initiated in 1999 in the health sector in Tanzania, provides the
framework of collaboration among the stakeholders, MOHSW, PMO-RALG, MOFEA, civil society,
private sector and DPs including UN agencies active in Health. It coordinates financing, planning,
and    monitoring mechanisms     and  therefore aims  at  creating   synergies, while  reducing  transaction
costs. Central in the SWAp is the implementation of MOHSW policies and the HSSP.

The stakeholders in the SWAp agreed on a Code of Conduct in the health sector Tanzania. It aims
at increasing transparency, improved predictability and allocation of financing, reduced transaction
costs and reduced administrative demands placed upon government. The SWAp Committee is the
agreed    overall body  for dialogue  among   all stakeholders    in health. There  is one annual   planning
meeting and one Joint Annual Health Sector Review (JAHSR). Topics discussed are the MTEF, the
progress of implementation of the HSSP, the Public Expenditure Review and jointly agreed topics.

The SWAp technical committee serves as a joint monitoring body of the goals and activities of the
health sector. There are several sub-committees of the Technical Committee which ideally comprise
a range of stakeholders, including the PPP technical sub-committee, the Monitoring and Evaluation
Technical Working Group, the Health Financing Committee, the Maternal, Newborn & Child Health
Partnership,    the NATNETS      Steering  Committee     within   the malaria  programme,     the  HIV/AIDS
Committee, the Human resources for Health Task Force.

The Development Partners Group for Health (DPG Health) is a collection of 20+ bi-lateral and multi-
lateral agencies    supporting  the health sector  in Tanzania.    The  DPG   Health   group  has  organised
itself in accordance   with  the JAST,   with a three  person   lead  arrangement    (troika) and  the WHO
providing secretariat functions.

7.4.2     Health Basket Fund Committee

The Health Basket Fund (HBF), a joint funding mechanism, was created in June 1999 and is part of
the SWAP approach.
The basket consists of two elements:

                                                      71
-   The   central    basket,      funding   the  Ministry    of  Health    head    quarters   and   other   central
    organisations with central support functions.
-   The district    basket,   funding   running    costs for District  and   Municipal    Council health  services
    based on the CCHPs. The district basket aims at providing a stable and predictable resource
    base for local councils, complementing the District Health Block Grant from the Government of
    Tanzania. It also provides funds for PMO-RALG and RHMTs to oversee implementation of the
    district health services.

The Basket Financing Committee (BFC), comprising representatives of the MOHSW, PMO-RALG,
MOF and basket-donors, is responsible for overseeing operation of the joint funding mechanism.
Tasks of the BFC are:
·   Approve the release of resources against the HSSP, MTEF and CCHPs; and
·   Ensure    that the   use of   basket resources    follow set  financial,    administrative  and  management
    procedures.

7.5     Assumptions for implementation of HSSP III

In the previous chapter many assumptions with regard to the health sector were mentioned, which
will not be repeated here. Three important external conditions should be in place for achievement of
the objectives of HSSP III:
·   Political  stability and  economic      growth:  Tanzania     has  known     decades   of political and social
    stability. The  assumption     that  it will continue   like  this is fair.  On   the contrary, the  economic
    situation in Tanzania has known periods of major instability and decline. Tanzania is to a large
    extent dependent on developments in the global economy. A major global economic crisis may
    have its impact on Tanzania's economic development.
·   Availability of  human     resources:   The    health sector   depends      on  mainly  on  the availability of
    human resources. It competes with other sectors to get the best people to join the workforce.
    Salaries,  working    conditions  and    career  perspectives      must  be  attractive to get  those  people.
    There  are   also  forces   that pull   health  workers  away   from     the sector,  within the  country  and
    abroad. Brain drain may constitute a serious threat to the sector.
·   Commitment of the population to health: More and more in Tanzania, there is an appeal to the
    population to take responsibility for health matters, in terms of financing for health interventions,
    in terms of organising preventive health activities, and in terms of participating in management
    of health facilities. This approach towards population commitment to health is relatively new and
    requires time to mature. Lack of community involvement may jeopardise the implementation of
    the HSSP III.

The process of annual planning at all levels will take into account the uncertainties and changes in
the context of the health sector.

8    Financing the HSSP
  8.1   Introduction

Financing  of   the HSSP      III takes   note   of the  critical shortage      of resources   facing   developing
countries like Tanzania. It also recognises the existence of non-discretionary resources, which are
mostly found    outside   the  Government      budget    frame.   The  strategy    is therefore  planning  service
provision based    on    the package   of   essential health    interventions   that  are cost-effective, with the
view that the    off-budget   resources     are  gradually   captured     in the   Government     budget  and  will
provide flexibility for funding Government priorities.

                                                         72
   8.2      Resources for the HSSP

The HSSP III will be financed from various domestic and foreign sources as summarised in Table 7.
Table 7. Sources of funds to finance HSSPIII
Source          On-budget                           Off-budget

                National Health Insurance Fund      Community Health Fund/ TIKA
                                                    Drug Revolving Fund
                                                    Council Own-Sources
Foreign         General Budget Support              Foreign Funded Projects and Programs
                Health Sector Basket Fund
                Foreign Funded Projects and
                Programmes
It may   be expected   that  funding  from domestic   resources         will gradually increase   in the  coming
period, since health sector is and continues to be one of the priority areas. It may also be expected
that funding from foreign resources will increase, as Development Partners have already signed a
new Memorandum of Understanding for continuation of the basket funding in July 2008, and other
partners  ­  not  participating  in the basket  ­ have   signed          agreements    with the   government                of
Tanzania    for financial assistance. Other  sources  of funds         come   from  insurance  and   cost sharing
schemes (CHF, NHIF, GRF, etc), from the private sector and from out-of pocket expenditure.
Since  2000,    nominal   public per  capita health expenditure          has  been  growing    at approximately
21%10.   Using this growth rate (linear extrapolation), the projected per capita health expenditure for
the next five years is as shown in the next table.
Table 8. Projected per capita expenditure (PCE) on health in Tanzania in USD
Fiscal Year       PCE (in US$
   2009/10            15.75
   2010/11            17.92
   2011/12            20.09
   2012/13            22.26
   2013/14            24.43
   2014/15            26.60
Although the growth of the budget is impressive, the budget available for health will still fall short of
2001 WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health estimates of US$ 34 per capita per year.
Given the projected/targeted inflation rate of single digit and assuming a stable value of Tanzanian
Shilling against  the  US$,  21%    nominal  increase  translates        to  double digit real growth  in  health
expenditure, surpassing the growth rate of GDP.
Linear projection of the on-budget expenditure estimates base on the last five years are:

         Amounts in USD (x 1 million)

10 Update of health Public Expenditure Review reports of 2000-2006
11 Expenditures can be divided into recurrent expenditures (expenditures that recur continually or very frequently, such as
salary expenditures or other recurring operational costs) and development expenditures (non-recurrent expenditures, such
as spending on capital infrastructure). Recurrent public expenditures in Tanzania are commonly broken down further into
wages and wage-related expenditures (Personal Emoluments, or PE) and non-wage expenditure (Other Charges, or OC).

                                                    73
For these projections the following assumptions were made:
-   The historical nominal annual growth rate of the recurrent budget is around 21%
-   The historical nominal annual growth rate of the development budget is around 31%
-   The historical nominal annual growth rate of total on-budget estimates is around 24%

Note that nominal growth rate of GDP is around 14%, with an inflation rate of 5 -7%. Therefore the
real GDP growth is 7%. All this suggests plateau in the future of the growth of health expenditure
and its share in both GDP and total government expenditure.

   8.3   Financing requirement for health interventions

In order  to determine     the  financing requirement      of the HSSP     III, triangulation  of   various  and
methods was used, depending on the availability of information. The basic approach was to analyse
the recurrent costs of the suggested interventions and project their future costs. In this way most of
the recurrent costs such as salaries, drugs, and general management are already included in the
costed interventions. The cost analysis also took care of scaling up of these interventions and new
investments in the sector.

Suggested    interventions  outlined  in this  HSSP    III document   were   matched   with   those  outlined in
MKUKUTA      cost   analysis    of planned    health   interventions: these     covered   the  intervention   of
Maternal, Newborn and Child Health as well as disease specific programmes. Other cost analysis
were taken from the recently developed documents such as the Primary Health Care Development
Program (MMAM) and Human Resources for Health Strategy. These include planned expenditure
on  human    resources     for health  development     and    management,       strengthening   District Health
Services   and  future infrastructural   development.      For those  components      for which     estimates of
future expenditure were not available the unit costing was based on estimates that were done in
previous   Ministry  of    Health   Medium     Term    Expenditure    Reviews     and    historical  records  of
expenditures found in the updates of the health sector Public Expenditure Reviews.

The total costs were derived by summing up the costs calculated of each intervention and health
services or activity specific costs. Activities are designated specific unit costs and quantities. In case
of treatment or prevention, cost per case or person was considered. Quantities are cases.

The projected estimates for the health sector expenditure in the next five year are presented in table
9 below. Detailed cost analysis matrices are available in the Department of policy and Planning on
request.

   8.4   Physical quantities of major cost drivers reflected in cost
         estimates

Table 10 highlights some of the key volumes of services or other quantities inherent in the costing.
For example, the cost for HRH in 2009/10 reflects the recruitment and retention of 3,025 doctors
and  26,043  nurses    and  the    in-service training of  8,599  staff.  Further,  the   costing   provides  for
antenatal care for 1,055,698 pregnant women, delivery care for 892,229 babies and immunization
for 6.5 million children.  This table also shows why the costs for District Health System and Health
Infrastructure go down so dramatically in 2011/12 as major construction projects for primary health
care are   completed.   It goes    up again   in the following  years    due the  fact   that strengthening   of
existing health centres and equipping is done from 2011/12 to 2014/15.                It is important  to  note,
therefore, that if the  available   financing  does  not   meet expectations,    or the   financing  gap  is not
addressed, the achievement of these output targets could be compromised.                  The exact nature of
the impact would need to be determined by the MOH, bearing in mind the priorities reflected in this
strategy.

Comparing the expected resource envelop and the estimated costs of implementing the plan, it must
be concluded that HSSP III is left with a financing gap of about 24% of the total requirements for the
next six years. However, the gap varies annually: it is larger in first two years (2009/10 and 2010/11)
and then begins to decline in the next two years in the final year (2014/15) it rises again beyond the
previous levels. Two major investment plans (the MMAM and HRH plan) especially the rehabilitation,
furnishing  and   construction  of   health  facilities and  multipurpose    zonal  training centers   require large
initial investments, and were developed independently, not against the background of a total resource
envelop. As a result the total health sector requirements are not evenly spread over the coming years.
The needs are reflected in the plans, but the MTEF planning process will result in more evenly spread
of investments and thus to less extreme differences over the years.

To address this imbalance, it is necessary either to improve the resource envelop or to scale down
some    of the  interventions or   a   combination  of  both  if priorities are shifted. The  likeliness  of  scaling
down the interventions is small since the package that is being proposed is already at a very minimum.
The strategy will therefore focus on seeking additional resources. The MOHSW will undertake strong
advocacy    for contributions  from    LGAs,  private   sector   providers,  FBOs   and  NGOs,   which   operate  at
local level, as well as the communities. Achievement of the MDGs in Tanzania is only possible through
major   investments,   beyond   the    capabilities of   the MOHSW.     Partnerships     for achieving   the  MDGs
should extent to partnerships in investments in health services.          At the same time it will be beneficial to
bring the off-budget resources into the budget frame, in order to reduce the gap. Moreover, resource
allocation and utilisation will have to concentrate on increasing efficiency and effectiveness.

9    Monitoring and Evaluation
  9.1      Introduction

Integration
Monitoring   and   evaluation   is essential  for   evidence-based     decision-making      and  for  accountability.
According to the health sector evaluation in 2007 the M&E for accountability purposes is acceptable in
Tanzania, as essential information can be provided to government and the international community.
However,    there  is room  for improvement.      The    M&E   for decision-making    is much    weaker,  not  least
because available information is not used appropriately.

For monitoring the developments in the health sector three elements come together:
·    The   MKUKUTA     monitoring,     which is the comprehensive      monitoring    of development    and   poverty
     alleviation in Tanzania, and which incorporates the monitoring progress towards achieving targets
     of the Millennium    Development      Goals  (MDGs).     The   MKUKUTA      and  MDG     indicators  for health
     activities are incorporated in the monitoring of the strategic plan.
·    The   health  services routine    and  non-routine    monitoring   systems     (Disease  Surveillance,   Health
     Management Information System, Health Programmes Reporting Systems, Demographic Health
     Surveys, Health Systems Survey, and other health surveys and research) collect information on
     health services on regular basis (quarterly, annually or four-yearly) in addition to ad hoc.
·    The   Local   Government      monitoring   system,    which   feeds    information  to  the PMO-RALG       and
     sectoral ministries. The CCHP indicators are reported annually as part of the LGA technical and
     financial progress monitoring.

The  monitoring    of the HSSP     III makes  use   of  the  three systems,   and   combines   information   coming
from  different  sources.   Indicators   produced    for  existing  systems     are integrated   into the HSSP    III
monitoring.

Strategic and annual planning
The  strategic   planning   concentrates     on  expected     results. In   the logical  framework     methodology
expected results encompass impacts, outcomes and outputs. The six years' period of HSSP III does
not allow realistic formulation of quantified targets. However, the MTEF planning and annual update of
that planning   is the  right moment     for targeting   and  formulation    of specific outputs.    The translation
process from strategic to annual planning, therefore, is crucial. At all levels serious annual planning
has to be implemented, and the eleven strategies have to be the guiding topics in that planning.

9.2      Monitoring HSSP implementation progress
9.2.1    Indicators

For the purpose of monitoring the health sector and progress of the HSSP III, a series of indicators
has  been    developed,   divided     into health  status  indicators,    health   services   indicators   and   health
systems   indicators. (Please,    see   the  table  at the  end   of  this chapter.)   The    indicators can    also be
categorised   in input,  process,     output,    outcome   and   impact.   Some    of  the    indicators can    only be
measured     every  four  years,    when    a    demographic    health    survey   is  undertaken,    others    can  be
measured annually or even quarterly, when using the routine information system. Few indicators can
only be measured through special surveys, as the information is not collected in the existing system.
The  indicators  were   selected    covering  most    critical issues  of  HSSP    III implementation.    However,    a
number   of  indicators  also have    operational    importance   for  quarterly   planning   of activities at  various
levels.
In addition, in programme specific strategic plans, other indicators are mentioned. The information on
those indicators will be collected as planned, and will be used for monitoring and evaluation of those
specific programmes.
As mentioned     above,  the  strategic    indicators are  to  be translated   into   quantified annual   targets    and
outputs in the MTEF planning process.

9.2.2    Data Collection Systems

The health sector performance assessment will be based on six data collection systems:

Demographic Health Surveys and other national level surveys
In Tanzania     every four  years     a Demographic     Health    Survey   (DHS)    is  undertaken,    which    collects
essential information on health status and health services utilisation of the population. It is the most
reliable source  of   comprehensive      community-based       health  information     in Tanzania.   It provides    the
major   source   of information     for  measuring     health   status information,     or health    services'   impact
indicators.  In addition,   there   are  other   periodic, nationally  representative      surveys   (e.g., HIV/AIDS
Indicator Survey    and  Malaria    Indicator  Survey)  and    research    projects,   which  can  provide   important
health status information.
The regular National Health Accounts and the Public Expenditure Reviews provide information on the
way the health sector is financed.

Routine health information systems
In Tanzania     the  HMIS    (or  MTUHA)      provides     information    on   health  services   outputs,   diseases
diagnoses    and  other  health   systems    information   on   quarterly  and   annual    basis. In  addition,   many
programmes      have  their parallel    information  system,    providing  information     on  their service    delivery.
Integration of those information systems is targeted during the coming HSSP III period. Adaptation to
information   requirements    is    planned.     The  routine   systems    provide     information,   which     can  be
aggregated and analysed annually in the Health Statistics Abstract and the Health Sector Performance
Profile.

LGA quarterly technical progress reporting
The annual LGA reporting is supposed to make use of 20 CCHP indicators. In practice, the technical
progress   reporting  is insufficiently    used,  not  least   because     not all existing   indicators  are   geared
towards decision-making at the CHMT level. During the HSSP III period, harmonisation of HMIS and
CCHP     progress   reporting    will be   achieved.   The     indicators  formulated     for the HSSP      III will be
incorporated into the LGA progress reporting system, to harmonize the present CCHP indicators. With
the improved system, the CHMT will provide quarterly information on locally analysed key indicators.

Mid-Term Review and End-Review
During   the implementation      of   HSSP   III two  reviews   are  foreseen:   the   mid-term   and    end-of-period
review.  These   reviews    will provide   in-depth   analysis   of  the  eleven   strategies.   Internal  and   extern
experts will present a joint analysis and give recommendations on further implementation of the HSSP
III. For this reviews, the teams will make an analysis of the indicators, which are provided in chapter 6.

                                                         79
Baseline and End Survey
The MOHSW in collaboration with PMO-RALG and LGAs will perform two surveys: at the beginning
and at the end of the HSSP III period. These surveys will concentrate on important information, which
is not collected routine wise,  but is needed  to     make an  assessment  of status of the infrastructure,
PPP, work procedures, etc. The information will enable a profound end-of-period analysis, necessary
for defining priorities for the next HSSP period.

Milestones
The milestones are agreed annually between stakeholders in the Joint Annual Health Sector Review
(JAHSR) and often concentrate on processes of HSSP implementation.

9.3     Time planning

The time planning of the information collection is based on quarterly, annual, periodic and five-years
data  collection and  analysis. Some    surveys   are   planned outside  the  health sector and  the time
planning  may    not coincide with  the   HSSP    III planning period. The   systems  together provide  a
comprehensive information system that can be used for planning activities, for reviewing progress and
for end-evaluation of HSSP III.

The annual reporting to the JAHSR will include progress reporting on the key HSSP III indicators,
integrated in the Health Sector Performance Profile.
