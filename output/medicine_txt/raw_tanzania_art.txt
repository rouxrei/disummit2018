FOREWORD
During the past 24 years of the HIV epidemic in Tanzania, the
country has responded in several ways, including putting in place
a series of strategic plans and preventive interventions. Since
November 2004, a nation-wide care and treatment programme
aimed at providing care and treatment to People Living with
HIV and AIDS (PLHAs) is being implemented. The main focus
of the program is to improve access to ARVs and Home Based
Care (HBC) for as many PLHAs as possible.
By December 2007 (three years after the program was launched)
and in collaboration with a number of development partners,
a total of 165,000 eligible patients have been started on ARVs
and those who are not eligible yet are being closely monitored
through Care and Treatment Centres (CTCs) spread all over the
country. In spite of this impressive success in a relatively short
time, there is still a need to expand the services to more PLHAs.
This requires an increased effort to ensure the availability of
not only ARVs, but also well-trained staff, adequate space and
supporting facilities such as laboratories and counselling facili -
ties -- in short, a quality and functional health system.
HIV and AIDS is a rapidly evolving field. This is particularly
true in the field of care and treatment of individuals infected
with HIV. Newer and more potent drugs are continuously be -
ing developed and used; and knowledge of the existing drugs in
terms of their efficacy, as well as short and long-term side effects
is becoming clearer as we gain more experience. The second
edition of this document, "The National Guidelines for Clinical
Management of HIV and AIDS," was produced only a few years
4 Foreword
ago. However, recent developments and experience in the eld
of HIV and AIDS care and treatment has made it necessary for
the country to come up with another edition of these guidelines
to re ect the changes that have taken place. is will help to
improve the quality of care and treatment of our patients.
In this edition, all chapters have been reviewed to include new
information. Due to observed changes and developments the
number of regimens to be used for care and treatment of HIV
and AIDS has been expanded to give clinicians more exibility
in providing quality care.
e current edition is also presented in a style that will hopefully
be easy to read, while at the same time serve as a basic reference for
information on HIV and AIDS management. Like the previous
one, it covers Adult and Paediatric HIV and AIDS management;
Nutrition; Management of Opportunistic Infections; Home
Based Care and the Continuum of Care; and Counselling for
HIV Testing as well as ART adherence. Other areas covered
include: health facility certi cation, standard precautions in
care settings and laboratory services, post exposure prophylaxis,
as well as ARV logistics and dosages.
As rapid changes will continue to take place in the eld of HIV
and AIDS, feedback from users of this manual is vital and
will be used to revise, improve and update the manual to keep
abreast with changes. For that reason, your timely feedback will
be highly appreciated.

Chapter 1: Overview
Epidemiology of HIV and AIDS
HIV and AIDS are a major global health problem. By the end
of 2007, it was estimated that a total of 33.2 [30.6 ­ 36.1] million
people worldwide were living with HIV and AIDS. Sub-Saharan
Africa is the world's most severely affected region. With only
10% of the world's population, it shelters about two thirds of the
global total number of people living with HIV and AIDS. One
in 12 adults in this region is reported to be infected with HIV.
Although there are now reports of declining trends in HIV in -
cidence in a number of countries, presumably due to changes in
behaviour and prevention programmes, the number of people with
HIV has continued to rise, due to population growth, and more
recently, the life-prolonging effects of antiretroviral therapy.
Since the first three AIDS cases were reported in Tanzania in 1983,
theHIVepidemichasspreadrapidlytoalldistrictsandcommunities
andhasaffectedallsectorsofthesociety.Duringtheyear2003atotal
of 18,929 AIDS cases were reported to the National AIDS Control
Programme (NACP) from the 21 regions, bringing the cumulative
total of reported cases since the epidemic broke to 176,102.
In 2007 about 2 million persons were estimated to be living with
HIV and AIDS, with approximately 600,000 (30%) in need of
ART. Recent data based on household surveys estimate the sero -
prevalence in adults aged between 15 ­ 49 years in Tanzania to be
7%, with a wide variation across the regions. Sexual intercourse is
the main mode of transmission of infection. That is why sexually
active individuals aged between 15 and 49 are most severely affected,
with women being at a higher risk of being infected than men.
12 Chapter 1: Overview
Today, in Tanzania as in most Sub-Saharan African countries,
HIV and AIDS are recognized not only as a major public health
concern, but also as a socio-economic and development prob -
lem. Data from a study conducted by the Adult Morbidity and
Mortality Project (AMMP) in 2002 in the districts of Hai,
Temeke and Morogoro rural showed that HIV/AIDS and TB
were the leading causes of mortality in those areas.
Impact of HIV and AIDS
Health Impact
The HIV pandemic has had a profound impact on the health
care system of all countries world wide but mostly those in
Sub-Saharan Africa. It has reduced resources available for other
health problems which has had an unfavourable effect on the
quality of health care services being provided. In Tanzania
for example, most of the urban district and regional hospitals
report a bed occupancy rate of up to 50-60% for HIV-related
conditions. And since health care personnel are also infected,
there is a human resource crisis in all health care facilities which
adversely affects the initiation of care and treatment programs
with antiretroviral therapy (ART).
The HIV and AIDS pandemic has interacted with other underly -
ing public health problems, particularly Tuberculosis (TB) which
has been established as one of the principal causes of death in
persons with HIV infection. National TB infection rates in
Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia have escalated over the
past decade. Since the mid-1980s, annual TB notification rates
in many African countries with well-organized programs have
increased fourfold, reaching peaks of more than 400 cases per
100,000 individuals. In some countries, up to 70% of patients
with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB are HIV-infected.
13
The majority of hospital admissions in Sub-Saharan countries
are due to HIV-related conditions including TB. It is therefore
very important that all HIV infected patients be actively screened
and promptly treated for TB.
Economic Impact
There is a close relationship between HIV/AIDS and economic
development. HIV and AIDS negatively affect economic growth
which makes it difficult for countries and individuals to initiate
adequate and comprehensive responses to the epidemic, due to
a weak economic base. Poverty is a powerful co-factor to the
spread of HIV and AIDS. The economically and socially dis -
advantaged sections of the population including women, youth
and other marginalized groups in society are disproportionately
affected by the epidemic.
Ill health and death due to AIDS have reduced agricultural labour
force, productivity and disposable incomes in many families and
rural communities. Data from Kagera, one of the regions most
severely affected by HIV and AIDS in Tanzania, indicate that
between 1983 and 1994 respectively, the annual Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) declined from USD 268 to USD 91. Although
this decline was multi-faceted, AIDS is believed to be a major
cause. Similar trends of declining GDP associated with reduced
agricultural production and an increase in number of AIDS cases
were observed in the coastal region of Tanga.
Social Impact
AIDS is widespread in both urban and rural communities and
mostly affects persons at the peak of their sexual and productive
lives. The death of a young adult often means loss of a family's
primary income generator. Studies conducted in Arusha, Kagera
14 Chapter 1: Overview
and Mwanza regions show a serious and growing breakdown
of social networks, which have up until now sustained African
societies. Materialistic practices are on the increase; orphans are
not only subjected to material, social and emotional deprivation,
but also lack opportunities for education and health care. Widows
and orphans are deprived of their inheritance rights (by relatives
of their deceased husbands) due to the application of outdated
traditional practices and customary laws. And often, widows are
blamed for the premature deaths of their husbands.
Despite these challenges, experience has shown that the epidemic
can be stabilized or reversed even in countries with modest re -
sources if a supportive environment exists. Programs to mitigate
the impact of HIV/AIDS should include among other things,
strong and high-level political leadership for HIV prevention;
a national HIV and AIDS strategic plan; adequate funding for
a national HIV and AIDS response; strong community involve -
ment and initiatives, and supportive policies. Data from Kagera
has shown that the decline in HIV prevalence rates was a result
of a combination of all these factors.
The components of a minimum package for HIV and AIDS
response include but are not limited to: blood safety initia -
tives, STD management and prevention, and care and support
for PLHAs including access to antiretroviral drugs. Others
are: functional referral systems and linkages; education to the
general community particularly the youth; condom program -
ming; prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT)
and voluntary counselling and testing (VCT).
National Response
The national response to HIV and AIDS has shifted hypotheti -
15
cally from one solely based on interventions aimed at prevention
to one that puts more emphasis on care and treatment as well.
Since 2004, the Government, in collaboration with partners,
initiated a care and treatment programme under the NACP.
Currently, a total of 172,736 HIV-infected people have been
enrolled at 152 NACP sites throughout Tanzania. However,
the scaling up of ART provision remains a challenge. Out of
the estimated 600,000 HIV-infected Tanzanians who qualify
for ART, only 136,700 (22.2%) are currently on ART (NACP,
2007). More vigorous efforts are needed to promote VCT; to
reduce HIV stigma among the public and health professionals;
to improve on the quality and quantity of human resources; to
improve ARV supply management; and to integrate HIV care
with other health services, such as TB.
Basic Facts about HIV
Aetiology of HIV
In Tanzania, infection with HIV is caused by HIV-1 subtype. No
infectionwithHIV-2hasbeenreportedyet.ThecommonHIV-1sub -
types (clades) in Tanzania are A, C, D and their recombinants.
HIV Transmission
HIV infection is acquired through sexual intercourse with an
infected partner, exposure to infected blood and blood products,
and from an infected mother to her unborn child, in the uterus,
during delivery, or from breast milk. More than 90% of adults in
Sub-Saharan Africa including Tanzania acquire HIV infection
from unprotected sexual intercourse with infected partners.
Transmission of HIV through body fluids other than blood
and genital secretions such as CSF, pleural fluid, and amniotic
fluids is also possible. However, HIV transmission resulting from
exposure to saliva, urine or sweat is not very likely, if at all.
16 Chapter 1: Overview
Pathophysiology of HIV Infection
Interaction between the viral envelope proteins (gp120) and recep -
tors on the cell membrane is critical for HIV to enter and infect
the host cell. High concentrations of the CD4 molecules and
co-receptors have been detected on the surface of T-lymphocytes
and macrophages. Other cells that have been found to have CD4
molecules on their surface include the Langerhans cells (found
in the skin) and the microglial cells of the brain.
Following entry of the virus into a susceptible host cell, using the
enzyme reverse transcriptase, the viral genome copies itself from
RNA to DNA genetic material. The viral DNA copy then enters
the nucleus of the host cell and becomes intimately incorporated
into the host cell's own DNA using the enzyme integrase, and the
virus becomes a permanent part of an infected person's nuclear
proteins of the infected cells. This is followed by a latent period
during which the provirus in the infected host cell nucleus waits
for an external stimulus to start reproducing.
When CD4+ T lymphocytes are stimulated by new virus or any
other infection, they will respond to these stimuli by increasing
viral replication. As more and more viruses are produced and leave
the host cell, the cell membrane weakens and ultimately leads to
the death of the infected CD4+ T lymphocytes. Other factors
whicharemostlyunknownleadtotherapiddepletionoftheCD4+
T lymphocytes. The decline in the CD4+ T lymphocytes count
is a reflection of a declining cellular immunity, which eventually
manifests itself by the appearance of opportunistic infections.
The Natural History of HIV Infection
During the past few years, major advances have been made in
understanding the complex pathogenetic mechanisms leading
17
to the spread of HIV infection over time and to the progression
of HIV disease and AIDS.
Initial infection with HIV (Primary HIV infection, PHI) is charac -
terizedbyarelativelybriefperiodofhigh-levelacutevirusreplication.
People who are newly infected are highly infectious although they
may test negative for HIV; particularly if they are tested using the
common tests that depend on detection of antibodies against HIV.
The high level of viraemia present at the time of sero-conversion
may persevere for about three months but eventually stabilize at
an individual "set point."
This is followed by an asymptomatic phase of the infection,
whereby the levels of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, the prime target cell
for HIV, gradually decline. The rate of decline varies substantially
among patients. Major factors that are known to influence the
rate of CD4+ T-lymphocyte decline in a patient include:
· Genetic factors
· Viral load (number of HIV-RNA copies/ml) at the "set
point"
· Viral characteristics
· Age
Studies of cohorts of patients over long periods, both clinically
and biologically, have demonstrated the value of measuring
viral load as the most powerful predictive indicator of disease
progression. A person's viral load and the number of circulat -
ing CD4+ T-lymphocytes/mm3 are the two most important
laboratory parameters to consider when assessing the need for
treatment. Viral load is the measure of disease activity and can
be used to evaluate the rate of the immune system deterioration
18 Chapter 1: Overview
before and during treatment as well as the risk of developing
resistance during treatment. The CD4 count can also be used to
evaluate the risk of complications, including the development
of opportunistic infections.
A higher "set point" has been shown to be associated with rapid
disease progression than a lower one. Infection with syncytium
forming viruses is associated with a more rapid rate of dis -
ease progression compared to non-syncytium forming viruses.
Development of severe immuno-suppression could occur within
2-4 years but may be delayed for more than 15 years. However,
in the "typical" HIV infected patient it takes 8-10 years. The
gradual decline of the immune function ultimately reaches a stage
where the CD4 count is below 200 cell/l, or where a patient
develops specific opportunistic (AIDS-defining) illnesses in a
proportionate amount to severe immunodeficiency. This is the
AIDS stage and if left un-treated, the patient ultimately dies.
The activation of the immune system by infections such as
TB and worm infestation accelerates the onset of immuno-
suppression. The risk of a rapid onset of immuno-suppression can
be minimized by initiating preventive therapy to opportunistic
infections, early detection and administration of effective and
appropriate treatment of infective conditions in persons with
HIV infection. Preventive therapies currently used include those
for TB, bacterial infections, Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia,
(PCP), toxoplasmosis and cryptoccocal meningitis.
Comprehensive and quality clinical care of persons with HIV
disease requires health care personnel to have appropriate clinical
knowledge and experience and laboratory support to identify
patients with subtle and/or gross features of HIV disease. Once
19
diagnosis of HIV infection is made, the goal of any treatment plan
is to limit or delay progression towards AIDS for as long as possible
in order to reduce morbidity and to increase survival rate.
Theoretically, the multiple steps in the replication of HIV provide
opportunities for intervention. As shown in the figure below,
therapeutic regimens may be directed at one or several of the
following stages essential for viral replication:
· Attachment of HIV to host cell
· Reverse transcription of viral RNA to DNA
· Integration of the proviral DNA into the host cells' DNA
Expression of the viral gene after it has been integrated into the
host cell's DNA includes the process of transcription of more
viral RNA and the translation of viral proteins.

20 Chapter 1: Overview
Antiretroviral drugs that are currently available in Tanzania
function by targeting either the Reverse transcriptase enzyme
or the Protease enzyme. This results into a halted viral replica -
tion and a consequent halting or reversal of further decline in
CD4+ T lymphocytes.
Clinical Progression of HIV Infection (see WHO
Clinical Staging Criteria in Table 8.1 in Chapter 8)
In the absence of anti-retroviral therapy, HIV infected patients
go through the following clinical stages:
Primary Infection (becoming HIV infected)
Most people who become infected with HIV do not immediately
notice that they have been infected, although some may have
a short illness soon after acquiring infection. This is known as
sero-conversion illness which may last for a few weeks and is often
accompanied by flu like symptoms with fever, malaise, enlarged
lymph nodes, sore throat, skin rash, and/or joint pains. During
this period of acute febrile illness there is a widespread dispersal
of the virus to different tissues, especially to the lymphoid system.
However, most newly infected persons are clinically asymptom -
atic in spite of this ongoing extensive immunological battle. At
this point, results from HIV blood tests that are designed to
detect the presence of HIV antibodies such as ELISA and Rapid
Immunoassays are usually negative.
Clinically Asymptomatic Stage
This stage may last for an average of between 8-10 years with
no symptoms, although the infected person may experience
swollen glands or a condition medically known as Persistent
Generalized Lymphadenopathy (PGL). All HIV infected indi -
viduals can transmit the virus but the chances of transmission
21
are higher with a higher viral load. Infected persons at this stage
are categorized as WHO stage 1.
Symptomatic HIV
Over time, the immune system loses the struggle to contain
the virus and therefore symptoms develop. Symptomatic HIV
infection is often caused by the emergence of opportunistic
infections. The most common infections include fever, respi -
ratory infections, cough, TB, weight loss, skin diseases, viral
infections, oral thrush, pain and lymphadenopathy. This stage
encompasses WHO stages 2 and 3 depending on the particular
opportunistic infection seen.
AIDS
The diagnosis of AIDS is confirmed when a person with HIV
develops one or more of a specific number of severe opportu -
nistic infections or cancers. Such conditions include Kaposi's
sarcoma, Cryptococcal meningitis, PCP, Toxoplasmosis and
CMV retinitis. This is WHO stage 4.

Introduction
The Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (HSHSP)
2008-2012 builds on the National HIV and AIDS Care and
Treatment Plan for People Living with HIV and AIDS (PLHAs)
which was developed in 2003. Between 2004 and 2006, a total
of 204 health facilities, mainly hospitals, had begun providing
care and treatment. From 2007 onwards the program rolled out
to include an additional 500 health centres and dispensaries.
The HSHSP calls for the provision of quality HIV and AIDS
care and treatment services at all health care facilities across the
country. Setting standards in the provision of care and treatment
will require the establishment and organization of effective
Care and Treatment Clinics (CTCs) at all health care facilities.
Different tools for the assessment and certification of health
care facilities, the training of health care workers, conducting
supportive supervision and clinical mentoring as well as for
monitoring the patients and the programme have already been
developed to facilitate the provision of quality care to PLHAs.
Identifying People Living with HIV and AIDS in
Need of Care and Treatment and Sensitization of
Communities
In order to meet the goals of the HIV and AIDS Care and
Treatment Plan an expanded effort involving all segments of
the health care system is required to identify patients in need of
care and treatment. Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT)
services are an important but not sufficient mechanism to identify
people in need of care and treatment services. Provider Initiated
26 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
Testing and Counselling (PITC) is being introduced to allow
more people who attend health facilities at the outpatient clinics
and in-patients wards to get tested and access care and treatment
services. However, people in both urban and rural areas need to
be sensitized using all available communication channels within
communities and health facilities, to come forward for testing
and counselling so that those in need of care and treatment can
be linked to those services.
Scope of Activities to Provide Care and
Treatment
The establishment of CTCs at health care facilities that have
been selected to provide care and treatment services including
ARVs has helped to increase the number of people being enrolled
and provided with HIV care and treatment. Once enrolled,
CTC clients are also linked to a wide range of other services
including TB, reproductive health and family planning, social
and spiritual support and home based care services.
The core elements of HIV services that need to be provided at
CTC level include basic education regarding the mode of HIV
transmission and disease progression, and management of disease
symptoms. This is done through the following:
· Education about behaviour change and condom use for
infected people (prevention for positives)
· Orientation to the care and treatment programme
· Education and regular counselling on life-long disease man -
agement, in particular on treatment adherence
· Education and counselling about actions that may delay
disease progression and reduce co-morbidities by addressing
issues regarding nutrition, food safety, clean water and use
27
of insecticide treated bed-nets
· Routine clinical care and nutritional assistance to malnour -
ished patients
· Proactive exclusion of co-morbidities such as TB and effec -
tive referral to TB clinics
· Prophylaxis for OIs as indicated by these guidelines (see
chapter 6)
· Assessing eligibility for ART (clinical staging, social eligibil -
ity and CD4 counts, see chapter 8).
· Effective referrals to essential hospital services such as ante -
natal clinics for MTCT; family planning advice before and
while on ART; STI or other specialized clinics
· Recording and reporting according to the established elec -
tronic and paper system
· Registration and appointment systems for effective treatment
continuation
· Referral to community services such as HBC, social welfare,
and legal support
In order to provide effective and quality HIV and AIDS Care
and Treatment, service delivery needs to be organized in a
manner to ensure efficiency, user friendliness and regular and
standardized follow up.
Organization of Care and Treatment Services
Staffing and Team Approach
For a CTC to function well, adequate and trained staff need
to have clearly outlined roles and responsibilities. Since HIV
and AIDS are now manageable chronic diseases, the principles
of chronic disease management need to be followed. Team ap -
proaches involving a patient and a family carer and a healthcare
team consisting of at least a triage nurse, a doctor and a treat -
28 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
ment/adherence nurse, will ensure the building of an ongoing
relationship between patient and the health care team for life-long
care. Regular scheduled visits that minimize drug depletion at
home require easily retrievable records and files and disciplined
observance to appointment schedules. Weekly CTC team meet -
ings to discuss bottlenecks and case studies will help to build
the team spirit, while quarterly staff meetings between heads
of relevant units involved in HIV care such as CTC, TB, VCT,
MCH/MTCT and in- patient will help to build better internal
cooperation and patient referrals.
The National Standard Operating Procedures manual outlines
the following staff roles for the various functions at the CTC:
· Registration and  appointments management; filling of CTC
1 and CTC 2 basic information; height and weight
· Triage: assessment of immediate medical needs, TB screening
questionnaire, support and referring the patient to the next
relevant unit or staff at the CTC
· Clinical management  
· Patient ART preparedness and adherence counselling
· Data collection and management
· Referral management within the hospital and with com -
munity organizations
Patient Visit Plan
At the initial clinic visit a triage nurse will assess the patient's needs,
register basic information, issue relevant forms, weigh the patient
and refer him/her to the relevant site. Blood will be drawn for a
confirmatory HIV test if there is doubt on the patient's status and
CD4 cell count, before the patient meets with a counsellor and
clinician. Given that CD4 test results will typically not be available
29
on the same day, the patient will be scheduled for a follow-up visit
with a clinician to discuss clinical staging and the test results.
At the follow-up visit, after consultation with a clinician, patients
who are recommended for and agree to initiate therapy will meet
with a counsellor to discuss issues related to adherence, medication
dosing and adverse event management. Another blood sample will
be drawn for tests that will help inform the treatment protocol and
identify baseline values for monitoring toxicity. Patients will be
scheduled for a follow-up visit after two weeks, then monthly for
adherence counselling follow up and clinical care and monitoring
of their response to therapy (including toxicity management).
During these visits, the patient will first meet with a counsellor,
then the evaluating clinician, have further examinations done
if necessary, before picking up their medication from the CTC
or pharmacy. After six months, the patient will be requested to
continue to visit the clinic once a month for adherence counsel -
ling and medication refills or if in need of clinical management.
CD4 counts and basic blood tests will be performed at six month
intervals. The patients will also see an evaluating clinician for
follow-up and to evaluate response to therapy.
Those who do not immediately qualify for treatment will require
regular monitoring of their status with assessment of clinical
staging and CD4 count every 6 months for all asymptomatic
cases (i.e. WHO stage 1) and all symptomatic cases (i.e. WHO
stage 2 and stage 3 with CD4 above 350).
All patients are advised to come to the CTC immediately should
their condition deteriorate prior to their next scheduled visit.
Adherence management and lifestyle counselling
Patient non-adherence to prescribed medication is a global
30 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
problem. Patients on ARV treatment should be strongly encour -
aged to identify an adherence or treatment assistant. This can
be any person identified by the patient (e.g. a family member,
friend, colleague, or community member) to support the patient
in treatment protocols.
During their monthly visits to the CTC, each patient will be
screened for TB and provided with cotrimaoxazole prophylaxis
as indicated. In addition an adherence and lifestyle counselling
session which will be used to identify possible lapses of adher -
ence and reinforce key practices related to optimal adherence.
Patients will also receive information and counselling on trans -
mission risk reduction (positive prevention), nutritional and
family planning advice, and adverse event management. Other
psychosocial needs such as social or legal support, disclosure of
HIV status, mental health, referrals to home based care services
and facilitation for joining PLHA support groups will also be
addressed during the counselling session.
Note: Adherence assessment can be done in various ways includ -
ing pill counting, self reporting, home-based care reporting and
review of patient records.
Medical Records System
Patient identification cards (CTC 1), Patient Record Forms
(CTC 2), Registers (pre-ART and ART) and Reporting Forms
(for Cross-sectional and Cohort analysis) have been designed
to facilitate patient identification, and patient and programme
monitoring respectively. In addition, an appointment book to
record booking appointments and tracking lost to follow up
patients is also included in the patient monitoring system.
The Patient Identification Card (CTC1) is a card with a pre-
assigned unique patient identification number issued at the
31
registration section of the facility during the first visit. The
card is for patients on ARV treatment as well as HIV positive
clients who are not yet on treatment but are being monitored
by the programme. The card should be kept by the patient and
used for identification purposes at every visit.
It is important that the patient carries treatment relevant informa -
tion with him/her whenever he sees a new clinician, such as when
he transfers to another facility. The same initial identification
number will be retained to avoid lost to follow up and double
recording of the patient.
The Patient Record Form (CTC2) is a form initiated at the first
visit for all HIV positive persons attending the CTC. It is issued
by the facility registration unit of the CTC by the attending
clinician or by the attending clinician's order. The form has a
unique ID number, copied from the Patient Identification Card.
It is kept in a file and retained in the facility registry or dedicated
HIV and AIDS care and treatment cabinet for retrieval at each
visit. Key information on patient management is filled in by the
attending clinician.
Registers
There are two types of registers used at the CTC: the Pre-ART
register and ART register.
The Pre-ART register is a tool for tracking and monitoring
the progress of patients that are enrolled in HIV care as they
become eligible for ART. All patients who first enrol for HIV
care, whether they are on ART or not, are initially listed in the
pre-ART register and counted as enrolled in HIV care. This
includes patients who transfer in with or without records, who
were previously receiving care at another facility but are not
32 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
yet on ART. The only patients who will NOT be entered into
the pre-ART register are patients on ART who transfer in with
records. Patients who were taking ART but do not have confir -
matory records will be entered into the system as new patients
and screened for eligibility (i.e. new CTC 2, new entry in pre-
ART register, eligibility screening). Once the patient begins
ART, he/she is transferred to the ART register and is no longer
tracked through the pre-ART register.
The ART register is a tool used for patient and programme
monitoring. However, it is only used AFTER a patient has
started ART. The purpose of the register is to collect the same
information (transferred from their individual CTC 2s) about
an entire group of patients in a single location (the register).
Note: The information on the CTC 2 form facilitates the moni -
toring of individual patients and that collected in the register
facilitates the monitoring the whole group of patients.
Reporting
Reporting at the CTC should be done as follows using the ap -
propriate reporting forms and tools:
Monthly and Quarterly Reports
A summary of newly enrolled patients is reported monthly, and
a cross-sectional (cumulative total) summary of all patients
currently in care and on ART from a single health facility (or
a single project within a large facility, with its own registers) is
reported on a quarterly basis. This is done using a cross-sectional
reporting form.
The monthly section covers the first to the last day of the previ -
ous month while the quarterly section covers the first to the last
33
day of the previous quarter. The cross-sectional form is filled
using data from the pre-ART and ART registers. It provides the
following important information:
· New patients enrolled and eligible for ART but not yet
started on ART
· New patients on ART (in the last reporting period; not
transfer in)
· Cumulative patients enrolled in HIV care (including transfer
in)
· Cumulative patients ever started on ART
· Patients currently on ART and currently in care (non-ART
plus ART)
· Patients currently on ART and what proportion are on first
line and second line regimens
· Subset of patients on treatment or prevention for OIs  
Programme monitoring
Programme monitoring is done at the facility-level as well as
higher up in the system using a cohort analysis reporting form
which comprises a collection of indicators for ART start-up
groups (monthly cohort) with their status at 6 months, 12 months,
and 24 months. Data is gradually filled out by a member of the
Care and Treatment Team as results become available and then
transferred to an identical cohort analysis report form that is
filled out by the District Coordinator/Supervisor for submission
to higher levels in the system. The cohort analysis reporting
form provides information that helps the Care and Treatment
Team and district, regional and national levels to monitor how
well the programme is doing with regard to patients started on
ART. It contains information on the following:
34 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
· Surviving patients
· Patients still on the first line regimen
· Patients that were able to work at 6 and 12 months
It also provides a comparison between patients with 6 months
of ART and other patients with 6 months of ART elsewhere.
Because the data from the cohort analyses are of critical impor -
tance, it is essential for the District team's designated person
in charge of patient monitoring to fully verify it. This requires
going back to the registers to re-calculate the results for each
monthly cohort.
An Appointment Book should be kept by a member of the Care
and Treatment Team at the registration unit and filled after the
patient has received the date for the next visit. It should contain
the patient's name, date, unique CTC ID number, the reason
for visit and a column for the patient's show up. Information on
patient show up is crucial for tracking missing patients who can
easily be identified and traced if the patient show up column is
properly filled out.
Each facility participating in the National Care and Treatment
Programme should identify a specific person to be responsible
for care and Treatment data handling and reporting.
Linkages Across a Continuum of Care
Effective linkages with a variety of care-related providing units
within the facility and with partnering programmes in the com -
munity are encouraged at all levels. Partnerships and regular
dialogue between the CTC and support programs in the commu -
nity need to be established within the district in order to ensure
a continuum of care through functional referral mechanisms.
35
Dialogue can be promoted through the expanded Council Health
Management Team (CHMT) or through continuum of care
subcommittees. The following programmes or services should
be considered when developing a continuum of care:
· PMTCT  
· VCT and PITC
· STI
· TB Clinics
· Community and Home Based Care including PLHA support
groups
Certification of Health Facilities to Deliver HIV
and AIDS Care and Treatment
In order to have as many health facilities as possible qualify for the
provision of care and treatment to PLHAs, the National AIDS
Control Programme (NACP) developed a service strengthening
and certification procedure which involves the following steps:
· Assessment of the availability and quality of essential ele -
ments to start and/or expand care and treatment
· Identification of areas for strengthening and improvement to
upgrade health facilities for the provision of comprehensive
care to PLHAs
· Issuance of certification to health facilities to enable them
to start or expand care and treatment once they have met a
minimum set of criteria
The setting of standards helps to ensure that care and treatment
services are delivered at an appropriate quality. It also provides
an opportunity for health facilities to identify needs and channel
resources to meet those needs.
36 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
Figure 2.1: Preparing facilities for certification
In collaboration with other divisions of the MoHSW, the Care
and Treatment Unit of the NACP continues to target new
facilities where care and treatment can be administered on a
regular basis. Assessment tools and checklists with minimal
criteria to provide care and treatment services have already been
developed by NACP.
Health authorities at regional and district level such as members
of the RHMT and CHMT and partner organizations supporting
the roll out of care and treatment in respective regions must be
involved in assessing the facilities as well as in the preparation
and support of strengthening plans.
Between 2004 and 2006 more than 200 health facilities were
assessed by multidisciplinary assessment teams, comprising
clinical, nursing, laboratory and pharmaceutical experts and
involving health staff at national, regional and district facilities
and partner organizations.

After 1 year
37
The Strengthening Plan is the key tool in preparing facilities for
participation in the care and treatment programme. It is jointly
prepared and agreed upon by assessment team members, facility
officers in charge and the DMO.
Planning for strengthening the facility's capacity should include
a set of functioning related services within the continuum of
care including among others, VCT services, coordination with
CHMT and Multisectoral AIDS Committees (MACs), and
NGO community based services.

Roll Out to Certify Health Centres and
Dispensaries
From 2007 onwards Care and Treatment services will reach an
increasing number of people living in rural areas. This will be
achieved through roll out to health centres and dispensaries.
Assessment tools and minimum criteria lists have been developed
allowing sites to qualify for three degrees of service delivery.
These include:
· A Care and Treatment initiating site
· An ART refilling site or
· An outreach service site from the nearest hospital.
41
Facilities are categorized on the basis of the availability of the
following:
1. Supervision from district level
2. Adequate human resource (staff levels and qualifications)
3. Laboratory services
4. Infrastructure, including drug store
5. Proper patient records and reporting system
6. Counseling and testing services

Management of Antiretroviral Medicines
Introduction
Proper management of medicines ensures optimal use of resources
to avail quality drugs to patients when they need them. The pro -
cess of management involves identification of the drugs needed,
acquisition of the needed drugs from reliable sources (e.g. MSD)
and ensuring proper utilization of the drugs at end user point.
HIV and AIDS related commodities are relatively expensive and
therefore they require proper handling to ensure effective use.
Rational Drug Use (RDU) of ART
Rational drug use is the process of delivering medication that
is appropriate to a patient's clinical needs at the appropriate
frequency and duration and at the lowest cost.
ART is a complex undertaking that involves a large variety and
quantity of drugs. It is a life long treatment that is in constant
development. It is therefore very important to use drugs rationally
since irrational drug use (especially in the context of ART) may
have unwanted consequences at both individual and population
levels, including:
42 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
· Treatment failure
· Rapid development of drug resistance
· An increase in the risk of toxicity  
· Wastage of money
Prescriptions
Only trained and authorized prescribers in certified health care
facilities are allowed to write ARV prescriptions.
Dispensing
Antiretroviral drugs are prescription-only medicines. They
should only be dispensed to treatment-ready patients with clear
instructions and advice. The dispenser should ensure that the
prescription is appropriately written and signed by an authorized
prescriber before issuing the drugs. The prescription for ARVs
should clearly indicate the name, age, sex of patient, medicines
and dosage, and should include the name, signature and pre -
scriber's code (where applicable). Additionally, ARVs should
only be given to the named patient or appointed adherence
assistant. Adequate time should be scheduled for antiretroviral
dispensing and counselling.
The pharmacist/dispenser should make sure that the patient
understands the dosage and drug intake schedule as well as
instructions regarding the storage and food requirements. The
pharmacist/dispenser should also caution patients about possible
side effects, respond to specific questions and problems related
to ARV treatment encountered by patients and advice them
on measures to be taken to reduce these side effects including
immediate return to the clinic when that happens.
Records
In order to facilitate efficient administration and management
43
of ARVs, all information regarding ARV issuance should be
recorded in a dedicated register book and ART patient card.
Pharmacy Register
The Pharmacist/Dispenser should record and sign all the dis -
pensed ARVs in the dedicated register book located in the
dispensing unit at the pharmacy. Reports on drug consumption
and stocks of drugs should be sent to the Ministry of Health and
Social Welfare through the DMO for program monitoring.
Patient Identification Cards
Each patient must be issued with a patient identification card,
include for medication (CTC 1). Patients (or appointed adher -
ence assistants where patients can not collect the medication
themselves) must present the cards to the dispenser every time
they collect medicines and all medications received must be
recorded on the card.
Storage
To ensure proper control and security of ARVs and other drugs, the
following procedures should be used at the facility pharmacy:
Stock must be kept in a high security storage area with a single
pharmacist/pharmaceutical technician (at any one time) respon -
sible for receipts and issues.
Normal stock records must be kept for all receipts and issues
along with a running balance, and ledgers maintained for each
item. At the end of each month, the pharmacist in charge must
check the physical stock against the stock records.
ARVs must be stored at the appropriate temperature and/or refriger -
ated such as drugs like Kaletra (Lopinavir/Ritonavir) if required.  
44 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
Commodities must be stored according to the first-to-expire
first-out (FEFO) procedure and stock management.
Damaged and expired commodities should be immediately
separated from usable ones in the inventory and disposed using
the laid out procedures.
The pharmacist should maintain adequate stocks of ARVs for all
required medications (first line, second line, adults, paediatrics)
at all times.
Procurement
The procurement of ARVs shall be done by the Medical Stores
Department which will then distribute the medicines to all
the accredited facilities across the country. Requisition of
antiretroviral drugs from the facilities will follow the normal
procedure for other drugs except that a separate requisition
form will be used.
On receipt of the drugs at the facility, the pharmacist shall
check the ARVs brought by MSD and sign the delivery note.
An adequate buffer stock of drugs must be kept at all times and
closely monitored to avoid stock outs.
Ordering ARVs
Ordering of ARVs will be done by the pharmacist using the
"Integrated Logistic System" (ILS) register which is made of two
forms: Form A1 - Dispensing Register for Antiretroviral drugs
(ARVs) and Form A2 - Report and Request for Antiretroviral
drugs (ARVs). The built-in inventory control system is designed
to ensure that drugs are ordered on a monthly basis using existing
stock levels and not morbidity data.
45
Relevant data on the consumption of antiretroviral medicines
must be kept and sent to the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare every quarter as per the MSD indent format.
Orders to the Medical Stores Department (MSD) should be
timely and made well in advance to allow supplies to reach the
facilities in time.
Collaborating with Clinical Staff
The pharmacist will not be required to re-order ARVs using
morbidity data because consumption data will be available.
However, the pharmacist will need to work with clinical staff
to obtain an estimate of the number of patients expected to be
enrolled on therapy.
The pharmacist also needs to keep clinical staff informed of
the current stock levels of ARVs, particularly of items nearing
stock-out. In the event of nation-wide supply shortage, the
pharmacist should communicate this information to clinical
staff so that they can pursue the best course of action.
Monitoring of Adverse Drug Events
Monitoring involves continuous reviewing of program perfor -
mance against its targets. Drug Management system monitoring
helps to ensure that
· clients get the health commodities they need when they
need them
· planned logistics activities are carried out according to
schedule
· records are correctly maintained and reports submitted in
a timely manner for re-supply and decision making
46 Chapter 2: Organization of HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment
Monitoring and reporting of adverse drug events should be done
according to the Tanzania Food and Drug Authority (TFDA)
guidelines. Adverse drug reactions reporting forms (yellow
forms) will be distributed to facilities that have been certified
to deliver ART.
Audit
Procurement, storage, distribution and dispensing procedures
and records and stock in hand will be subject to internal and
external audit. Given the cost and complexities of handling
ARVs, frequent auditing is anticipated.

Chapter 3: HIV and AIDS Prevention
Introduction
The provision of quality HIV clinical care at the various levels of
the health care system in Tanzania offers a unique opportunity
to deliver prevention messages and interventions. People in
need of care who have established a trusted relationship with
health care providers are motivated and hence likely to accept
the need for behaviour change and practices necessary to stop
further HIV transmission. Abstinence, faithfulness, condom use
and early diagnosis and treatment of STIs can be highlighted
during clinical care.
Treatment and Prevention of Sexually
Transmitted Infections (STIs)
STIs are co-factors for HIV transmission and therefore health care
workers should ensure the provision of quality STI services in all
health facilities through the use of simple diagnostic procedures
and the syndromic approach. This can be achieved through
· Regular training of health care workers
· Supportive supervision
· Regular supply of essential commodities and consumables,
including male and female condoms for STI prevention
purposes.
Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission
(PMTCT) of HIV
PMTCT interventions aim at reducing the risk of HIV trans -
mission from infected mothers to their babies during pregnancy,
childbirth and during breast-feeding. Quality PMTCT services
should be integrated within Reproductive and Child Health
50 Chapter 3: HIV and AIDS Prevention
services in all health care delivery settings in the country, and
should include:
· Counselling and Testing at a Reproductive and Child Health
services setting
· Provision of ARV prophylaxis to the HIV positive mother
and her infant to prevent Mother to Child Transmission
(MTCT)
· Infant feeding counselling and support
· Safer delivery practices
Community members, particularly men and other close fam -
ily members should be educated to play a more active part in
supporting mothers to access and use PMTCT services and
in reducing stigma, denial and discrimination. In addition,
postpartum services including family planning and reproduc -
tive health information and services should be offered within
PMTCT settings or through referral to all women who wish to
prevent future unintended pregnancies.
Condom Programming
Both male and female condoms provide effective protection
against sexual transmission of HIV. The key elements to suc -
cessful condom programming include:
· Easy access to condoms within and outside the health care
setting
· Provision of education on consistent and proper condom
use by all healthcare staff
· Appropriate social marketing programmes for condoms
51
Workplace HIV and AIDS Policy and Programme
for the Health Sector
The Health Sector has about 60,000 health personnel in different
categories. Many of them are in direct contact with infected per -
sons and face the risk of infection through occupational exposure.
They are also at risk by virtue of being sexually active members of
the population (depending on their sexual behaviour) and other
situations that increase their vulnerability to HIV infection.
As highly respected members of their communities who are
frequently sought for general advice on healthy lifestyles, health
personnel need to be trained, sensitized, and capacitated to be
"HIV and AIDS-competent." This can be done by
· Providing appropriate means of protection including Post
Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) as detailed in Chapter 13
· Ensuring that protective gear and supportive policies/environ -
ment for workplace HIV interventions are available on site
· Orientation on basic principles and interventions of HIV
prevention, care, treatment and support
Prevention of HIV Transmission Through Blood
Transfusion
Transfusion of HIV contaminated blood is the surest way of trans -
mitting HIV infection. An effective and well functioning National
Blood Transfusion Service will ensure the regular availability of
adequate amounts of safe blood in all transfusing health facilities.
The government will ensure regular availability of reagents and
supplies for safe blood transfusion through the pull system.
HIV and AIDS Prevention for Sex Workers and
Other Vulnerable Groups
Sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men, and
52 Chapter 3: HIV and AIDS Prevention
intravenous drug users, have disproportionately higher HIV
prevalence rates compared to the rest of the population. Increasing
access to services and interventions for these groups will reduce
the transmission of HIV infection not only among these groups,
but also within the general population. NGOs, CBOs and other
agencies working with these groups need to be supported particu -
larly in ensuring an adequate supply of condoms.
Youth (in and out of school) and HIV and AIDS
Priority health sector interventions for youth comprise the
expansion of quality youth-friendly health care services, imple -
mentation of youth-focused promotion activities and behaviour
tracking through sentinel surveillance. There is also a need to
design innovative condom promotion programmes with the
full participation and involvement of the youth to ensure an
appropriate link between intention and outcomes.
Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT)
Voluntary Counselling and Testing has proved to be effective in
influencing change in sexual behaviour and practices. However,
in order for VCT services to function properly they need to be
easily accessible, user-friendly and be linked to a health facility,
home based care service and other HIV support services.
Family Planning Services
Family planning and effective use of contraceptives can pre -
vent unintended pregnancies among women who are infected
with HIV, thus decreasing the likelihood of HIV infection in
children and as well respond to their reproductive rights. Most
contraceptive methods, including hormonal contraceptives and
Intra-uterine devices (IUDs), are appropriate for the majority of
HIV infected women. Service providers should assist women who
53
want to avoid pregnancy to make informed, voluntary choices
of contraceptive methods that are best for them. Condom use
should be promoted for dual protection, since other family
planning methods that are more effective for the prevention of
pregnancy, do not offer protection against STI/HIV. Condoms
(both male and female) are the only contraceptive method that
provides protection against HIV and other STIs.
Reduction of Stigma and Discrimination
Stigma and discrimination constitute major factors in inhibiting
service utilization and a proper response to the HIV and AIDS
epidemic.InformationEducationandCommunication/Behaviour
Change Communication (IEC/BCC) interventions aimed at
stigma reduction need to distinguish between felt and enacted
stigma. Felt stigma is a collection of prevalent feelings that in -
dividuals harbour about their condition and the likely reactions
of others, while enacted stigma refers to actual experiences of
stigmatization and discrimination, such as the attitude of health
workers, relatives and other members of the community.
Health workers need to be targeted with interventions to reduce
stigma and discrimination within the health service delivery
setting. As bearers of health-related information and knowledge
in their communities, health workers need to be appropriately
informed and sensitized on the issues surrounding HIV and
AIDS so that they can use this knowledge to reduce stigma
within the general population.
Male Circumcision
There is sufficient evidence on male circumcision (MC) as an
HIV prevention strategy. A number of studies in South Africa,
Kenya and Uganda, among others, have demonstrated that MC
54 Chapter 3: HIV and AIDS Prevention
has a significant protective benefit against HIV infection with
reported reduction in HIV incidences ranging from 50-60%
among circumcised men. Countries are being encouraged to roll
out MC plans in order to prevent new HIV infections especially
among its youth population. However, planning for large-scale
MC interventions needs to take into account the medical risks
and benefits, as well as the social, cultural, economic, sexual,
and other risks and benefits. These must be fully addressed and
community buy-in assured at all levels. Priority should be given
to areas with low MC prevalence and high HIV prevalence for
comparison purposes. MC interventions must run concurrently
with all other prevention strategies.

Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a
Health Care Setting
Introduction
HIV and other blood borne pathogens (BBPs) such as Hepatitis B
and Hepatitis C may be transmitted in health care settings from a
patienttoahealthcareworker,fromahealthcareworkertoapatient
orfromapatienttoapatient.TheoccupationalriskofbecomingHIV
infected from patients in health care settings is mostly associated
with injuries from sharps such as needle stick injuries, splashes of
blood or other body fluids. Patient to patient transmission usually
results from contaminated equipment and other materials, which
have been incorrectly or inadequately processed.
This can be prevented by implementing the following infection
preventionandcontrolmeasures:adherencetostandardprecautions
such as hand hygiene; use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
such as gloves; proper healthcare waste management; processing
of instruments by decontamination; cleaning and sterilization
using High-Level Disinfectants (HLDs); and observing safe work
practices. The use of such measures will help to minimize the risk
of HIV transmission in the health care setting.
Prevention of HIV Transmission
through Standard Precautions
Standard precautions are a simple set of effective practice guide -
lines that create a physical, mechanical and chemical barrier to
protect health care workers and patients from infection with a
range of pathogens including blood borne pathogens. Standard
precautions are used when caring for all patients regardless of
diagnosis, (WHO).
58 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
Components of Standard Precautions
The key components of standard precautions include:
· Considering every person (patient or staff ) as potentially
infectious and susceptible to infection
· Hand hygiene practices including hand washing, use of hand
antiseptics, alcohol hand rub and surgical hand scrubs
· Use of PPE such as gloves, masks, goggles, caps, gowns, boots
and aprons
· Use of antiseptic agents for cleansing skin or mucous mem -
branes prior to surgery, cleaning wounds, or doing hand rubs
or surgical hand scrubs
· Safe work practices such as avoiding recapping or bend -
ing used needles, proper handling of sharps, linen, patient
resuscitation and patient care equipment
· Safe disposal of infectious waste materials and sharp wastes
· Processing of instruments by decontaminating and thoroughly
cleaning and sterilizing them with HLDs using recommended
procedures
Implementation of Standard precautions
In practice, implementation of standard precautions includes
the following interventions:
Hand Hygiene
Hand hygiene techniques significantly reduce the number
of disease-causing micro-organisms on hands and minimize
cross-contamination of healthcare-related infections, such
as those from health care worker to patient. Common hand
hygiene procedures include routine hand washing, hand
washing with antiseptics, antiseptic hand rubs and surgical
hand scrubs.
59
The need to apply hand hygiene procedures is determined by
· intensity of contact with patients and/or blood and bodily
fluids
· likelihood of microbial transmission
· patients' susceptibility to infections
· procedures being performed
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Personal protective equipment safeguards clients and health care
staff from being contaminated or infected by disease causing
micro-organisms. Examples of PPE include:
· Gloves (surgical, examination, elbow-length or heavy duty)
· Fluid impermeable aprons
· Masks and caps
· Protective eyewear
· Boots    
Gloves
The use of a separate pair of gloves for each patient helps prevent
the transmission of infection from person-to-person. HCWs
should use gloves when:
· they anticipate contact with blood, other bodily fluids,
mucous membranes, broken or cut skin
· handling items contaminated with blood, other bodily fluids
and/or secretions
· performing housekeeping activities
· handling healthcare waste (should use utility gloves)
· they have skin lesions on their hands
· performing surgical procedures and vaginal examinations
in labour (must use sterile gloves)
60 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
Gloves are not required for routine care activities during which
contact is limited to a patient's intact skin.
Aprons
Rubber or plastic aprons provide a protective waterproof barrier
for the healthcare worker while at work.
Protective eyewear
Eye-wear, such as plastic goggles, safety glasses, face shields, or
visors that protect the eyes should be used when a splash of
blood is anticipated such as during labour and delivery and in
surgical or casualty units.
Boots
Rubber boots or leather shoes provide extra protection to feet
from injury by sharps or heavy items that may accidentally fall.
They must be kept clean. Healthcare workers should avoid
wearing sandals or shoes made of soft materials.
Handling and Disposal of Healthcare Waste,
Such as Sharp Instruments
The most common mode of transmission of blood borne
pathogens in a healthcare setting is through skin puncture with
contaminated needles or sharps. Such injuries often occur when
sharps are recapped, cleaned, or inappropriately discarded.
The following should be taken into consideration when using
sharps:
· Use a sterile syringe (preferably a retractable syringe) and
needle for each injection and reconstitution of each unit of
medication.
· Never leave a needle inserted in a vial cap when withdrawing
multiple doses.
61
· Minimize handling of injection equipment whenever pos -
sible.
· Always keep your fingers behind the needle.
· Do not disassemble needles and syringes after use.
· Do not recap, bend or break needles prior to disposal.
· Do not over-fill sharps containers; filling them more than
three-quarters (3/4) full may cause needle stick injuries. It
is also forbidden to press overflowing waste bins in order to
push waste down.
· If it is necessary to recap needles, such as when using a va -
cutainer in venopuncture, use the single-handed scooping
method.
Sharps containers (safety boxes)
Using safety boxes helps to prevent injuries from sharps waste.
Safety boxes should be puncture-proof, leak-proof, and tamper-
proof. In other words, difficult to open or break.
Safe use of sharps containers (safety boxes)
1. All sharp containers should be clearly marked "SHARPS"
and/or have pictorial instructions for the use and
disposal of the containers.
2. Place sharp containers away from high-traffic areas and
within arm's reach to where the sharps will be used.
3. Do not place containers near light overhead fan
switches, or thermostat controls where people might
accidentally touch them.
4. Never reuse or recycle sharps containers for other
purposes.
5. Dispose safety boxes when 3/4 full.
6. Ensure that no sharp items are sticking out of containers.
7. Dispose sharps containers by incineration, burning,
encapsulating, or burying.
62 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
Safe Disposal of Waste Contaminated with Bodily
Fluids
Proper waste management involves the following steps:
· Segregation
· Handling and Storage      
· Transport        
· Treatment or Destruction      
· Final disposal       
Segregation
This refers to separation of waste by type at the point and time
it is generated. Different types of waste should be placed in
containers that are color-coded. In the absence of color-coded
containers, other containers may be used but they should be
properly and visibly labeled.
Refer to appropriate document(s) for further information.
Note: The segregation of waste at the point and time it is
generated will help to achieve proper waste disposal of infec -
tious waste and protect other staff at the workplace and the
neighbouring community.
Home-based Healthcare Waste Management
Community Health Nurses and other healthcare service
providers providing care in homes and the community should
handle and dispose sharps and other infectious waste (such
as soiled dressings and supplies) in the same manner it is
done in a healthcare setting.
63
Proper Processing of Instruments and Other
Contaminated Equipment
There are three basic infection prevention processes recom -
mended for the reduction of disease transmission from soiled
instruments and other reusable items. These are: decontamina -
tion, cleaning, and sterilization or high-level disinfection (HLD).
Regardless of the operative procedure, the steps in processing
surgical instruments and other items are the same.
Figure 4.1: Infection prevention processes for instruments and
reusable items
64 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
Decontamination is a process that makes inanimate objects
safer to be handled by staff before cleaning. It inactivates HBV,
HBC and HIV and reduces, but does not eliminate, the number
of other contaminating micro-organisms.
Cleaning is the physically removal of all visible dirt, soil, blood
or other bodily fluids from inanimate objects. Cleaning also
removes a sufficient number of micro-organisms hence reduc -
ing risk of infection by those who touch the skin or handle the
object. The process entails thoroughly washing with water, soap
or detergent, rinsing with clean water and drying.
High-level disinfection (HLD) is a process that eliminates all
micro-organisms except some bacterial endospores from inani -
mate objects. It entails boiling, steaming or the use of chemical
disinfectants.
Sterilization is a process that eliminates all micro-organisms (bac -
teria, viruses, fungi and parasites) including bacterial endospores
from inanimate objects through the use of high-pressure steam
(autoclave), dry heat (oven), and chemical sterilants or radiation.
Proper Handling of Soiled Linen
Key Steps in Processing Linen
· Housekeeping and laundry personnel should wear utility
gloves and other personal protective equipment as indicated
when collecting, handling, transporting, sorting and washing
soiled linen.
· When collecting and transporting soiled linen, they should
handle it with minimum contact to avoid accidental injury
and spreading of micro-organisms.
· All cloth items (such as surgical drapes, gowns, wrappers) used
during a procedure should be considered as infectious. Even if
65
there is no visible contamination the item must be laundered.
· Soiled linen should be carried in covered containers or
plastic bags to prevent spills and splashes, and confined to
designated areas (interim storage area) until transported to
the laundry.
· All linen in the laundry area should be carefully sorted before
washing. Do not pre-sort or wash linen at the point of use.
· When hand-washing soiled linen, soak in hot water with
0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for thirty (30) minutes,
wash separately in hot water and then air dry.
· Clean linen must be wrapped or covered during transporta -
tion to avoid contamination.
Cleaning Floors
Detergents and hot water are adequate for routine cleaning of
floors, beds and toilets. In case of spillage of blood or other bodily
fluids, the area should be cleaned with a chlorine-based disinfectant
followed by thorough cleaning with soap and hot water.
All health care workers must be conversant with standard pre -
cautions.
Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
The most common method of exposure to HIV infection is
through unprotected sexual intercourse (sexual exposure) such
as during sexual assault. Other potential areas of risk of HIV
infection include contact with infectious bodily fluids, such as
during accidents or when safety precautions are not followed
(occupational exposure).
Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is the immediate provision
of preventive measures and medication following exposure to
potentially infected blood or other bodily fluids in order to
66 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
minimize the risk of acquiring infection. Several clinical studies
have demonstrated that HIV transmission can be significantly
reduced by 81% following the immediate administration of
antiretroviral agents.
Occupational Exposure
Exposure prevention is the primary strategy for reducing occupa -
tional HIV transmission, that is, the chance of acquiring infection
following exposure to blood and other bodily fluids (semen, vaginal
secretions and breast milk) from an infected person. These bodily
fluids should be considered as being infectious.
Effective post-exposure management entails the following ele -
ments: Management of Exposure Site, Exposure Reporting,
Assessment of Infection Risk, Appropriate Treatment, Follow-up
and Counselling
Management of Exposure Site
Wounds and skin sites that have been in contact with blood or
bodily fluids should be washed with soap and water and mucous
membranes flushed with water. There is no evidence that using
antiseptics for wound care or expressing fluid by squeezing the
wound reduces the risk of blood-borne pathogen transmission.
While the use of antiseptics is not contraindicated, the applica -
tion of caustic agents (e.g. bleach) or injection of antiseptics or
disinfectants into the wound is not recommended.
Exposure Reporting
When an occupational exposure occurs, the circumstances and
post exposure management procedure applied should be recorded
in the exposed person's confidential form for easy follow up
and care. Information to be recorded in the health worker's
confidential medical report should include:
67
· Date and time of exposure
· Details of the procedure being performed and the use of
protective equipment at the time of exposure
· Type, severity and amount of fluid that the healthcare worker
was exposed to
· Details of the exposure source person
· Medical documentation that provides details about post-
exposure management
Risk Assessment for Occupational Exposure
In addition to the type of bodily fluids, the risk of acquiring
HIV also depends on the type and severity of exposure and the
HIV status of the source person.
Depending on the sero-status of the source person, the following
criteria can be used to determine the risk of exposure:
· Percutaneous injury
· Mucus membrane exposure
· Non intact skin exposure
· Bites resulting to blood exposure to either person in -
volved
Table 4.1: Risk of transmission after occupational exposure
BBP Mode of exposure Risk of infection/
exposure
HIV Percutaneous 0.3%
HIV Mucous membrane 0.03-0.09%
HBV Percutaneous 10-30%
HCV Percutaneous 0-10%
Note: Standard precautions should be adhered to when contact
with any type of body fluid is anticipated.
68 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
Evaluation of the Exposed HCW
Healthcare workers exposed to HIV should be evaluated within
hours rather than days. A starter pack should be initiated within
2hrsafterexposureandbeforetestingtheexposedperson.Thereafter,
exposed healthcare workers should be counselled and tested for
HIV at baseline in order to establish infection status at the time
of exposure. PEP should be discontinued if an exposed healthcare
worker refuses to test. To facilitate an effective choice of HIV PEP
drugs, the evaluation should include information on the type of
medication the exposed person might be taking and any current or
underlying medical conditions or circumstances (such as pregnancy,
breast feeding, renal or hepatic disease) that might influence drug
selection. Vaccination against Hepatitis B should be considered in
the case of large volume needle-stick injury.
Evaluation of the Source Person
Evaluation of the source person should be performed when the
exposed healthcare worker agrees to take PEP.
If the HIV, HBV and HCV status of the source person is un -
known perform these tests after obtaining consent. The exposed
healthcare worker should not be involved in obtaining consent
from the source person.
If the source person is unknown, evaluation will depend on
other risk criteria.
Do not test discarded needles or syringes for viral contamination.
Drugs for HIV PEP
For most cases of exposure to HIV a combination of AZT
and 3TC should be used. However, for exposure that poses an
increased risk for transmission see the following table.

Timing of Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
PEP should be initiated as soon as possible preferably within 2
hours after exposure. Studies suggest that PEP may be substan -
tially less effective if started more than 24-36 hours post-exposure
and not effective after 72 hours.
Follow-up of HIV Exposed Persons
Follow-up is based on clinical examination and laboratory
testing to determine the sero-conversion and adverse effects of
the ARV drugs.
HIV antibody tests should be performed for at least 6 months
post-exposure (i.e. at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6 months).
HIV testing should also be performed for any exposed person
who has an illness that is compatible with an acute retroviral
syndrome, irrespective of the interval since exposure.
If PEP is administered, the exposed person should be monitored
for drug toxicity by testing at baseline and 2 weeks after starting
PEP. Minimally, it should include a full blood picture (FBP),
renal function test (RFT) and hepatic function tests (LFTs).
Exposed persons should be re-evaluated within 72 hours, after ad -
72 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
ditionalinformationaboutthesourceincludingserologicstatus,viral
load, current treatment, any resistance test results or information
about factors that would modify recommendations is obtained.
Prophylaxis should be continued for four weeks if tolerated.
If ARV prophylaxis fails and the exposed person becomes HIV
infected, he/she should be referred to a CTC for proper HIV
care and management.
HIV PEP in Sexual Exposure
Sexual exposure comprises an act of unprotected voluntary or
forced sexual intercourse (rape/sexual assault), as well as in the
case of slipped or broken condom during sex with discordant
partner. The consequences of sexual exposure include a potential
risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/
HBV and unwanted/unplanned pregnancy.
Appropriate Management of Exposed Persons
Informed consent (whenever possible) should be obtained before
examination and collection of any forensic evidence that might
be needed in subsequent investigations. Younger children need to
be managed at specialised sites that have the expertise in dealing
with traumatized children and the prescription of ART.
Healthcare providers are responsible to provide appropriate
comprehensive care for rape survivors, including
· Management of life threatening conditions and sustained
injuries
· Immediate detailed history taking, precise documentation
of the victim's details and circumstances of the assault as
well as confidential reporting to appropriate institutions
73
· Thorough physical and genital examination as well as col -
lection of specimen (blood/saliva/hair/semen/high vaginal
swab/dry and wet mount preparations, etc.) for laboratory
investigations for STIs and forensic evidence, as soon as
possible (within 24 hours) after the rape incident
· EvaluationandprophylaxisforHIV,HBV,STIsandpregnancy
when indicated, i.e. PEP using antiretroviral therapy, presump -
tive treatment of STIs and emergency contraception
· Counselling, crisis prevention and provision of on-going
psychosocial support to rape survivors, so as to reduce/
minimize immediate rape trauma disorder and long-term
post-traumatic stress disorder
· Provision of mental health care
· Follow-up care to monitor other possible infections and
provision of psychological support, regardless of whether
PEP prophylaxis has been started or not
· Referral of the survivor to appropriate organs (police/legal
services), according to local laws and regulations
Risk of HIV Transmission after Sexual Exposure
Risk of transmission of HIV varies with type of sexual exposure
as shown in the table below:
Table 4.5: Risk of HIV transmission after sexual exposure
Types of exposure (from an HIV
positive source)
Risk of infection per exposure
Receptive oral sex 0-0.04%
Insertive vaginal sex 0.03-0.09%
Receptive vaginal sex 0.1-0.3%
Insertive anal sex 0.03%
Receptive anal sex 0.5-3%
74 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
When deciding whether to offer PEP or not, consider that risk
of transmission following sexual exposure is high if any of the
following factors were present:
· Blood
· Survivor or assailant with a sexually transmitted disease
with inflammation such as gonorrhoea, chlamydia, herpes,
syphilis, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, etc.
· Multiple assailants or multiple penetrations by assailant(s)  
· Ejaculation by assailant
· Anal penetration
· Obvious trauma to the genital area
· The assailant(s) is HIV positive
Factors to be Considered before Initiation of PEP
Factors to be considered before initiation of PEP for non-
occupational exposure are similar to those for occupational
exposure. They include:
· HIV status of potentially exposed person  
· HIV status of exposure source person if available. If unknown,
PEP can be initiated while the status is being assessed and
discontinued if serostatus of exposure source person is
confirmed negative
The decision to begin PEP should not be based on the likelihood
that the perpetrator is infected or delayed pending the test results
of the exposure source (unless immediately available). Rather, it
should be based on the perpetrator's transmission risk behaviour
and the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, particularly
genital ulcers, which can facilitate HIV transmission.
Note: Exposure to persons who have recently seroconverted may
carry a higher risk of transmission because of high HIV viremia.
75
Basic Steps to be Taken after Sexual Exposure
· Perform counselling and testing at baseline before admin -
istering PEP. It is important to establish survivor's baseline
HIV status before administering PEP in order to prevent
the potential for developing drug resistance, should the
individual be HIV positive.
· If the rape survivor is HIV negative administer the initial
(first) dose of PEP as early as possible. The efficacy of PEP
decreases with the length of time. Offer PEP promptly,
preferably within 2 hours but not later than 72 hours of
being raped. If the rape survivor is HIV positive, refer the
person to CTC for enrolment and further management. Do
not offer PEP.
· Rape survivors presenting later than 72 hours after being
raped should not be offered PEP.
· If the rape survivor is not psychologically ready, the baseline
HIV test can be delayed by up to 3 days after commencement
of PEP. If the test result is positive, PEP should be stopped
and the patient should be referred to a CTC. It should also be
explained to the rape survivor that the HIV infection is not the
consequence of the sexual assault but from previous exposure.
· Provide psychosocial support and ensure adherence to PEP
regime. The rate of lost to follow-up is high in this group
of patients.
· Monitor for ARV drug toxicity and manage the conditions
(if present) accordingly.
76 Chapter 4: HIV Prevention in a Health Care Setting
Drug Regimen
The recommended treatment regimen is
AZT 300 mg 12 hourly+150mg 3TC 12 hourly daily for 4 weeks
A third drug, EFV or Lopinavir/r should be added if:
· There have been multiple perpetrators
· Anal penetration occurred
· There is obvious trauma to the genital areas
· One of the perpetrators is known to be HIV positive
The noted contraindications for each of the listed drugs should
be considered as per details in appropriate chapters.
Patient Monitoring
Routine testing with a full blood count and liver enzymes for
patients on AZT and 3TC is not recommended due to short
duration of therapy. Any blood tests to be performed should
be based on patient's condition.
Three months after the PEP period, the individual should return
for a confirmatory set of HIV tests to determine whether the
treatment was effective. If treatment was not effective and the
individual became infected, he/she should be enrolled in the
care program at the CTC and monitored appropriately as all
HIV positive individuals.

Chapter 5: Laboratory tests for
HIV and AIDS
Introduction
Laboratory testing is an important integral part of HIV and AIDS
care and treatment. The tests that are done provide additional
information on an individual's HIV status, the level of disease
progress, treatment eligibility and response to treatment, and
drug adverse reactions.
Tests for HIV Diagnosis
HIV Testing in Adults and Children over 18 Months
Diagnosis of HIV infection in adults and children older than
18 months is commonly done by detecting antibodies to HIV
using rapid tests or Enzyme Immunoassays (EIA). According
to the national testing algorithm, HIV infection is tested and
confirmed based on concordance results of two or three HIV
rapid tests done serially. The second test should only be done if
the first test is reactive (positive) and the third test only if the
two initial tests are discordant.
The national HIV rapid testing algorithm is made up of three
main HIV rapid tests. These are:
1. Bioline HIV1/2 for the first test
2. Determine HIV1/2 for the second test and
3. Uni-Gold HIV for the third test
The three rapid tests can be done using whole blood, serum or
plasma samples. Whenever possible, rapid testing will be done
with a finger prick sample. HIV rapid testing can be performed
in the laboratory or in non-laboratory hospital, clinic or com -
82 Chapter 5: Laboratory Testing in HIV
munity settings by health care workers trained to performed
HIV rapid tests. However, all testing done outside a laboratory
setting must be supervised by qualified laboratory personnel to
ensure accurate and quality results.
Figure 5.1: The National HIV Rapid Test Algorithm
The national testing algorithm for HIV enzyme immuno-assays
(EIA) is currently being developed by MOHSW.
Diagnosing HIV Infection in
Children under 18 months
A positive antibody test (rapid test or EIA) in infants below 18
months does not confirm HIV infection, rather exposure to
HIV (see for details chapter 7). The laboratory diagnosis of
HIV infection in infants and children aged <18 months is done
by detection of viral nucleic acid (RNA or pro-viral DNA) or
viral antigens (p24).
83
HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method is used
to confirm HIV infection in infants and children  18 months
of age. PCR can be used to diagnose HIV infection in most
infected infants by the age of 6 weeks. Capacity for PCR testing
has been developed at the four zonal consultant hospitals in
Tanzania. Samples for PCR testing can be whole blood or dried
blood spots (DBS) on special filter paper cards which need to
be transported to the zonal hospital laboratories.
Figure 5.2: HIV Testing Algorithm for Children below 18 months
Tests for Monitoring Disease Progress and
Treatment Safety
Tests for HIV Disease staging
CD4 cells progressively decrease as HIV disease advances and
immune status detoriates. Measurements of CD4 counts will be
important immunological markers of disease progression and
assist in decision making on when to start antiretroviral treatment.
In adolescents and adults , CD4 counts are reported in absolute
numbers (for details see chapter 8) while for children under 6
84 Chapter 5: Laboratory Testing in HIV
years CD4 are reported in %. (For details see chapter 7, table 7.1).
Capacities for measuring CD4 couints have been established at
all zonal, regional and district hospital laboratories. However
equipment to measure CD4% is currently only available at all
zonal and some regional and hospital laboratories.
Tests for Monitoring Responses to antiretroviral
Treatment
Succesful antiretroviral therapy results in decrease of viral load,
immune recovery and therefore increase in number of CD4 cells.
Periodically every 6 months the CD4 count is used to monitor
the immunological response to antiretroviral therapy.
When available, viral load maybe considered in addition to
clinical and immunological measurements to diagnose treatment
failure earlier or to access discordant clinical and immunologic
findings in patients in whom it is suspected that ART has failed.
Capacity for viral load measurements is currently limited to
zonal consultant hospitals.
Tests for Monitoring antiretroviral Treatment
safety (toxicity)
Antiretroviral drugs are known to produce short- and long
term side effects in some patients. Clinical follow up is crucial
supported by laboratory investigations. Capacity for testing hae -
matology indices and clinical biochemistry has been developed
at laboratories of all hospitals with a CTC in the country. The
frequency of monitoring depends on the ART regimen used
and is summarized in table 8.5 in chapter 8.
Furthermore toxicity ART drug varies in severity which determines
the clinical action to take. The following tables show the grading of
adverse events as a result of ARV drugs for adults and children.

Tests for diagnosing Opportunistic Infections
Common OIs including the laboratory investigations to confirm
diagnosis are discussed in chapter 6. For laboratory diagnosis
of common OIs such as TB, upper respiratory tract infections,
meningitis, diarrhoeas and septicaemia, diagnostic protocols
are available as standard operating procedures and should be
used. Laboratory capacity for TB AFB and general microscopy
exists at all hospitals and health centres. Culture for bacterial
infections can be performed at all zonal and regional hospitals.
Close team work between laboratory and clinical staff at the
CTC is required to optimize diagnostic capacities.
Laboratory Safety Procedures
Adherence to safety precautions in the laboratory should be
done at all steps starting from specimen collection, storage,
transportation and disposal of biohazard wastes so as to minimize
occupational risks. The risk of transmission of HIV, hepatitis
B virus (HBV) and other blood-borne disease agents can be
minimized if laboratory workers observe safety precautions
/procedures at all times. All specimens should be treated as
infectious. For more details, see chapter 4.
Sample Storage Procedures
All samples should be stored in tightly closed and labelled tubes
and kept in an upright position in racks. Temperature require -
ments should be observed during specimen storage and records
of all samples kept. Always dispose used or old specimens timely
by autoclaving and incineration.
Sample Transportation Procedure
Whenever the capacity for a particular test does not exist in the
laboratory on-site, efforts should be made by laboratory staff
87
to prepare samples for transportation to the nearest facility
with such capacity. When transporting samples from the clinic
to laboratory or from one laboratory to another, the following
should be observed:
· Specimens should be packaged appropriately according to the
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and put in appropriate
and safe containers before transporting them by road (bus or
vehicle) or air
· Dried blood spots samples (DBS) on blotting paper are
considered to be non-infectious and can be put in a letter
envelope and transported by mail or courier. Consult courier
and receiving laboratory for procedures and timing.
· A specimen delivery checklist should be used to verify that
there is a requisition form for all samples transported.
· Dispatch and receipt records of transported samples should
be maintained.
(For more details on DBS collection and transportation see
EID guidelines)

Chapter 6: Management of Common
Symptoms and Opportunistic
Infections in HIV and AIDS in
Adolescents and Adults
Introduction
Despite the availability of ART, it is important to bear in mind
that there is still no cure for HIV infection and AIDS. It is also
important to remember that HIV infected patients do not die
from HIV infection per se; rather from the various complications
resulting from the HIV induced immune deterioration. A size -
able proportion of HIV infected patients yield to opportunistic
illnesses. Fortunately, most of these illnesses are amenable to
therapy, and their early recognition and prompt treatment can
significantly reduce HIV associated morbidity and mortality.
And even where such illnesses cannot be cured, a lot can be
done to substantially improve the duration and quality of an
HIV infected patient's life.
This chapter highlights the following:
· Clinical features and treatment of the common symptoms
encountered in persons infected with HIV
· Prevention of common opportunistic infections and offers
guidance to their management
· Diagnosis and treatment of some opportunistic illnesses
seen in persons infected with HIV
92 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
Clinical Features Commonly Encountered in
Patients with HIV and AIDS
Fever
Fever in a patient may be due to a variety of causes. However,
the associated clinical features may inform the diagnosis. If no
pointing features to a diagnosis are present, as a minimum the
following should be done:
· Blood slide for malaria parasites
· Sputum for AFB
· Chest X-ray
· Urinalysis
· Hemogram (FBP)
Where facilities are available, and if indicated, the following
tests should also be done:
· Urine cultures
· Blood culture for TB and other organisms
· Blood for widal test (Extended widal)
Cough and Dyspnoea
Persistent cough and or dyspnoea can usually be attributed to
one of the following:
· Pulmonary TB
· Bacterial pneumonia
· Pleural effusion, commonly due to TB
· Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma
· Viral pneumonia or PCP
· Cardiac failure, commonly due to dilated Cardiomyopathy
· Pericardial effusion, commonly due to TB
93
Sometimes, it may not be possible to determine the underlying
cause of cough and dyspnoea on clinical history and physical ex -
amination alone. At such times, laboratory tests may be of critical
value. The recommended laboratory investigations include:
· Sputum for AFB x 3 (can be done at all levels)
· Sputum for pyogenic culture and sensitivity
· Chest x-ray
· Bronchoscopy (consultant hospitals)
· ECG and Echocardiography (where available)
Oral, Oropharyngeal and Oesophageal Candidiasis
Patients with oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis may
complain of pain and/or difficulty in swallowing, which may be
due to infection of the esophagus with Candida. On examina -
tion white painless plaque ("curd like") on buccal or pharyngeal
mucosa or tongue surface that can easily be scrapped off will be
seen. Where available, a barium swallow X-ray can be performed.
For treatment, any of the following may be used:
· Fluconazole orally
· Miconazole  
· Nystatin oral suspension
· 2% sodium benzoate or Gentian violet solution
· Ketoconazole
Vaginal Candidiasis
This is one of the common illnesses presenting with itchy curd-
like discharge. The diagnosis is largely clinical, and it can be
managed with:
· Clotrimazole pessaries
· Miconazole pessaries
94 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
· Fluconazole taken orally (in case of pessaries failure)
Weight Loss
Weight loss in persons with HIV induced illnesses including
AIDS may be due to:
· Reduced food intake
· Difficult/painful swallowing
· Diminished gastrointestinal uptake (malabsorption, diar -
rhoea),
· TB (a frequent cause of rapid weight loss)
· Intestinal worms
· Other concomitant debilitating diseases such as cancer
· Intractable vomiting
· HIV itself
The treatment of weight loss includes
· High calorie and protein feeds
· Treatment of the underlying cause
Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea in persons with HIV induced illnesses including
AIDS may be have a variety of causes including:
· Common pathogens such as Salmonella or Shigella
· Amoebiasis
· Chronic malabsorption
· Cryptosporidiosis
· Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection
· Isosporidiosis
· Clostridium difficile infection
95
Investigations:
· Examine stools for treatable causes such as Salmonella, Shigella,
V. cholerae, Amoeba, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
and Isosporium
Diarrhoea can be treated in the following ways:
· Rehydration with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) or
Intravenous (IV) fluids
· Treatment of underlying causes
· Nutritional therapy (see details in chapter 15)
· Anti-diarrhoeal drugs such as Loperamide (in persistent
diarrhoea among adults with no obvious treatable causes)
Persistent Generalized Lymphadenopathy (PGL)
Lymphadenopathy may be due to a number of causes including
the following:
· HIV itself  
· Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection
· Kaposi's Sarcoma  
· Lymphomas
· Other causes such as pyogenic bacterial infection with
regional lymphadenitis
Investigations may include:
· Aspiration of the fluctuant node with a 21G needle and
staining the aspirate for acid-fast bacilli (AFB)
· Lymph node biopsy for histological diagnosis
· Chest X-ray
· FBP and ESR
Treatment is mainly of the underlying cause.
96 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
Skin Rashes, Sores and Generalized Pruritis
General causes for the above conditions include:
· Generalized Pruritic Papular Eruption (PPE)
· Infestation with external parasites such as scabies
· Fungal skin infections (Dermatomycoses).
· Viral infections herpes zoster, herpes simplex, molluscum,
HPV
· Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)
· Bacterial skin infection such as Impetigo
· Seborrheic dermatitis and Sebo-psoriasis
Investigations:
The diagnoses are mostly based on clinical presentation; however,
when necessary the following investigations can be performed:
· Skin scrapings (for fungal element and Sarcoptes scabiei)
· Pus swab for culture and sensitivity
· Skin biopsy for KS
The following are recommended actions for the management
of different causes:
Scabies:
· Benzyl benzoate Emulsion, or 1% lindane lotion
· Cloxacillin or Erythromycin if secondarily infected
Dermatomycoses:
· Whitfield's ointment or Griseofulvin tablets for Tinea
· Clotrimazole or Miconazole cream for Candidiasis
Impetigo:
· Cloxacillin
· Erythromycin
97
Herpes simplex & Herpes zoster:
· Acyclovir
· Cloxacillin
· Analgesics
Pruritic Papular Eruption (PPE):
· Antihistamine, e.g. Cetirizine
· Antibiotics, e.g. Cloxacillin or erythromycin
· Antiretroviral therapy
Seborrheic dermatitis:
· Antifungal (systemic if severe)
· Steroids (careful if concomitant TB is suspected)
· 3% salicylic acid ointment
Kaposi's sarcoma
This depends on the extent and severity and the options include:
· Surgical excision
· Radiotherapy
· Chemotherapy
· Anti-retroviral therapy (preferably PI-based, especially when
extensive)
It should be noted that cancer conditions in HIV infected
patients are managed in the same way as when they occur in
patients that are not infected.
Altered Mental Status and Persistent
Severe Headache
The following are some of the possible causes for altered mental
status and severe headaches:
· Fungal meningitis, especially cryptococcal
98 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
· Tuberculous Meningitis
· Bacterial Meningitis
· Cerebral malaria
· Severe dehydration
· Septicemia
· Hypoglycemia
· Toxoplasma encephalitis
· HIV-dementia
· Depression
· Psychotic conditions
Recommended investigations include:
· Blood slide for malaria parasites
· Lumbar puncture for CSF examination including Indian
ink stain for cryptoccocal meningitis
· Salmonella and syphilis serology
· Blood cultures + sensitivity studies.
· Blood sugar
· Serum biochemistry where possible
Prophylactic Treatment of Common
Opportunistic Infections in HIV and AIDS with
Co-trimoxazole
Many opportunistic infections can be prevented by using cotri -
moxazole prophylaxis, particularly in the case of
· Bacterial pneumonias
· Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), and
· Toxoplasmosis
99
Indications for Prophylactic Treatment using Co-
trimoxazole
Prophylactic treatment using co-trimoxazole should be provided
for any of the following:
· Adults
· All HIV infected patients, in WHO Stage 2, 3 and 4
(see Chapter 8 for WHO staging criteria)
· Asymptomatic HIV infected individuals with CD4
counts of <350 cells/ml
Pregnancy
· All pregnant women throughout their pregnancy
· HIV exposed children
· All children born to HIV positive women starting at four
weeks of life or as soon as possible thereafter of age and
maintained in their first 18 months of life unless proven
HIV negative and mother has stopped breastfeeding
completely
· HIV infected children
· Children less than 12 months with confirmed HIV
infection regardless of CD4% or clinical stage
· Children  1 ­ 4 years who have symptomatic HIV (WHO
stage 2, 3 or 4) regardless of their CD4 %
· Children 1 ­ 4 years and have and have CD4 <25%
regardless of their clinical stage
· All HIV-infected children >5 years old should start or
continue CPT according to adult guidelines
Note:
1. Baseline haematology (FBC) is required before long-term
administration of co-trimoxazole.
2. Caution should be exercised when initiating CPT during
100 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
the first trimester of pregnancy in women who may not have
access to good nutrition, because co-trimoxazole can cause
a deficiency in folic acid.
3. Pregnant women who are receiving CPT do not need sul -
fadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), an additional medication to
prevent malaria
Dosage:
Foradults:One double strength tablet (160/800 mg) or two single
strength tablets once a day on a daily basis.
For children: See Annex 5, Paediatric Antiretroviral Dosing.
Duration:
If treatment with ARV is not available, CPT for adults and children
who qualify but are not on ARVs, should continue for life.
For those on ARVs, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis can be stopped
if CD4 count is >350 cells/ml.
Children who are born to HIV infected women can stop prophy -
laxis when HIV infection has been reasonably ruled out and the
risk of exposure, for instance, through breast-feeding has ceased.
Children older than 18 months can continue with prophylaxis only
if the diagnosis of HIV infection has been confirmed by serology.
Criteria for stopping:
· Occurrence of severe side effects such as severe cutaneous
reactions or fixed drug reactions
· If ART is initiated and CD4 count is above 350 cells/ml in
adults or above 25% in children
· If use of antiretroviral agents causes renal and/or hepatic
insufficiency or severe haematological toxicity
101
Follow up and monitoring:
Regular follow up is recommended, initially every month for the
first three months, then every three months if the medication
is well tolerated.
It is mandatory to monitor for side effects and adherence.
Monitoring includes assessment of skin reactions, measurements
of haemoglobin, and white blood counts every six months and
when clinically indicated.
Preventive Therapy against TB in PLHAs
There is sufficient evidence on the benefits of preventive therapy
against Mycobacterium tuberculosis for HIV infected individuals
in whom active TB has been excluded. In this category of HIV
patients, Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) can be offered at
a dosage of 300 mg daily for 6 months for adults. For children
if active TB can be excluded , the dosage is 5mg/kg body weight
daily for six months. IPT provides upto 18 months of protection
against TB. Further details on this are provided in chapter 10.
Treatment of Opportunistic Infections
It is very important that all efforts are made to deal with such
treatable conditions in people with HIV and AIDS, particularly
because they are managed at various levels of care in the health
care delivery system. Emphasis should be placed on early detection,
treatment and proper referral where necessary. What follows are
recommendations on how to identify and handle treatable causes
of morbidity as a result of selected opportunistic infections in
HIV infected individuals.
Viral Infections
Viruses that are commonly associated with HIV and AIDS
include:
102 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
· Herpes simplex virus
· Varicella zoster virus
· Human papilloma virus
Herpes Simplex Virus Infection (HSV)
The classical presentation of primary HSV infection includes:
· Fever
· Lymph node enlargement
· Small painful vesicles
· Painful ulcers on the mucosa and skin
· Pain along gluteal and upper thigh muscles (Sacral radicu -
lomyelitis) may occur with genital/rectal HSV
· Lesions that usually resolve within 10-21 days after primary
infection. The HSV then becomes latent in trigeminal and
sacral nuclei and may reactivate
TheclinicalfeaturesinpatientswithHIVandAIDSmayalsoinclude
persistent/erosive genital/peri-rectal ulcerations which are mainly
associated with HSV-2 and more recurrent herpetic lesions.
The diagnosis is usually based on clinical history and physical find -
ings. Laboratory tests include serology, culture, immunoflorescence
or immunoassay, but these are not practical in Tanzania.
Treatment
· Acyclovir 400mg orally three times daily for 7 days for mild
and moderate cases of HSV
· Acyclovir 800mg orally, five (5) times daily for 5 days for
severe and recurrent HSV
· Antibiotics such as Cloxacillin or Erythromycin should be
used when there is secondary bacterial infection
· Analgesics when pain is severe
103
Varicella-zoster Virus (Herpes zoster or shingles)
Clinical features of herpes zoster:
· Early symptoms include pain (often severe and radicular) and
fever followed by vesicular rash over involved dermatome(s)
2-4 days later
· Primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection usually results
in chicken pox
Herpes zoster in HIV infected individuals may be more severe,
with more recurrences and may involve more dermatomes in -
cluding the following:
· More lesions
· Disseminated disease associated with pneumonitis, hepatitis
and hemorrhagic skin lesions
· CNS manifestations including encephalitis and cerebellar
ataxia
· Prolonged healing time
· Bacterial super-infection
The diagnosis of herpes zoster is usually based on findings of
characteristic painful skin lesions at different stages of evolution
(e.g. erythema, papule, vesicles, and crusts) in a dermatomal
distribution.
Treatment
· Analgesics to relieve pain even though the pain may some -
times be unmanageable
· Acyclovir 800mg 5 times per day for 7-10 days
· IV/Oral Acyclovir 10 mg/kg/day 8 hourly for 7 days for
disseminated VZV or ophthalmic nerve involvement
104 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
· Erythromycin or Cloxacillin 500mg three times daily for 7
days for bacterial super-infection
· Paracetamol/Aspirin or Diclofenac, also Amitriptylin 25-
50mg nocte for post-herpetic pain (neuralgia)
Note: Use of steroids (prednisolone) in herpes zoster is not
recommended.
Bacterial Infections
Bacterial infections that occur with increased frequency in
persons with HIV and AIDS include:
· Respiratory infections:Streptococcuspneumoniae,Haemophilus
influenzae
· Septicemia: Non typhoid salmonella, Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa
· Cutaneous infections: Staphylococcus aureus
Note: Treatment of bacterial infections is the same as in non-
HIV infected individuals.
Fungal Infections
Fungal infections commonly found in association with HIV and
AIDS include: Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystic jiroveci,
Candida species, and Histoplasma capsulatum.
Cryptococcus neoformans
This is a major cause of meningitis in HIV infected persons.
Contrary to bacterial meningitis, the patient may not suffer
from fever in this case. However, severe headache with or with -
out meningism or altered level of consciousness is a common
presenting feature. Diagnosis depends on demonstration of
positive CSF Indian Ink preparation.
105
Treatment
· The preferred regimen is Amphotericin B 0.7mg/kg/day IV
+ 5 Flucytosine 100mg/kg/day administered orally for 14
days (induction phase), followed by Fluconazole 400mg/
day for 8 weeks or until CSF is sterile (consolidation phase).
Thereafter the patient is given maintenance therapy with
Fluconazole 200mg per day (suppressive phase).
· If the above is not available, give Fluconazole IV 400mg/
day for 10 days or until the drug can be administered orally
then continue with the same dose for 10 weeks. Thereafter
maintain 200 mg daily on alternate days as secondary chemo -
prophylaxis.
Candidiasis
Candidiasis is the most common fungal infection in HIV and
AIDS. Its diagnosis is mainly based on clinical findings and
the clinical manifestations depend on the site of disease, which
includes oral mucosa, pharynx, oesophagus, and vagina.
Note: Candidiasis in the oesophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs
is diagnostic of AIDS.
Treatment
The following drugs are recommended for the treatment of
Candidiasis:
· Miconazole nitrate
· Clotrimazole  
· 2% sodium benzoate solution
· Nystatin oral suspension
· Fluconazole 150mg/day or 200mg/day for 2-3 weeks (for
oro-pharyngeal candidiasis and others)
106 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
Note: Treatment should be continued until symptoms resolve.
Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia (PCP)
This condition is quite common in Tanzania especially among
HIV infected children. Patients with PCP usually present with
non-productive cough, fever, chest tightness and shortness of
breath that has evolved over 2-4 weeks. Chest signs may be
minimal despite severe shortness of breath.
A chest x-ray may show increased diffuse and symmetrical in -
terstitial markings or diffuse alveolar pattern with infiltrations
characterized by asymmetry, nodularity or cavitations. Normally
there is a "bat's wing's appearance" although the chest radiograph
may appear normal in 10-30% of patients.
Diagnosis:
Usually in clinical circumstances diagnosis is based on clinical
presentation and exclusion of other common causes of severe
dyspnoea.
Treatment of PCP
· Cotrimoxazole 160/800 mg 3 times/day for 21 days and in
severe cases give IV cotrimoxazole
· Forthoseallergictosulphur,andifavailable,giveTrimethoprim
12-15mg/kg/day + Dapsone 100mg/day for 21 days as well as
Clindamycin + Primaquine for 21 days
· Adjuvant therapy with steroids may also be beneficial in
severe cases. Give Prednisolone 40mg twice daily for days 1
to 5, then 40mg once daily for days 6 to 10, and then 20mg
once daily for days 11 to 21
· ForprophylaxistherapygiveTrimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole
(TMP-SMX) as shown above
107
Protozoa
Toxoplasma encephalitis
Clinical features include:
· Focal paralysis or motor weakness depending on the brain
area affected
· Neuro-psychiatric manifestations corresponding to the af -
fected area in the brain
· Altered mental status (forgetfulness etc.)
Diagnosis is predominantly based on clinical findings after
exclusion of other common causes of neurological deficit. If
available, a CT scan is very useful for confirmation.
Treatment
For acute infection Sulphadiazine tabs 1 gm 6 hourly +
Pyrimethamine tabs 100mg loading dose, then 50mg /day +
Folinic acid tabs 10mg /day for 6 weeks.
After six weeks of treatment give prophylaxis therapy with
Sulphadiazine tabs 500mg 6 hourly + Pyrimethamine tabs 25-
50mg /day + Folinic acid tabs 10mg /day.
For those allergic to sulphur replace Sulphadiazine tabs with
Clindamycin capsules 450mg 6 hourly.
Discontinue maintenance therapy when CD4 count is >200 cells/
ml, initial therapy is completed and patient is asymptomatic.
Primary prophylaxis therapy for toxoplasmosis can be accom -
plished with Trimethoprim­Sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
tabs 160/800mg administered orally/day.
For those allergic to sulphur, give Dapsone tabs 50mg/day +
108 Chapter 6: Management of Common Symptoms and Opportunistic Infections in
HIV and AIDS in Adolescents and Adults
Pyrimethamine tabs 50mg per week + Folinic Acid tabs 10 mg

Intestinal Protozoa
For intestinal protozoa which is a common cause of diarrhoea and
difficult to diagnose, the recommended treatment is Albendazole
tabs 800 mg BD (400 mgr twice daily) for one week.

Conditions

Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-
related Conditions
Introduction
The majority of children with HIV acquire the infection from
their mothers during pregnancy, labour and delivery or after
birth during breastfeeding. The absolute risk of transmission
without any intervention is between 5-10% during pregnancy;
10-20% during labour and delivery, and 10-20% during breast
feeding. The child of an HIV infected mother acquires HIV
antibodies from his/her mother during pregnancy and via breast
milk if breastfed.
HIV infected infants may not have any signs or symptoms of
infection soon after birth but usually develop features of infection
in the early infancy period, although these features may overlap
with those of other common childhood diseases. The passively
acquired maternal antibodies may persist in the infant for be -
tween 9­18 months of age even if the child is not HIV infected.
The correct terminology used to describe the infant of an HIV
infected mother is "HIV- exposed infant." Children under 18
months of age with a positive antibody test (rapid test or EIA)
born of HIV-infected mothers or whose mother's HIV status is
unknown are also referred to as "HIV-exposed infants."
The natural history of perinatal HIV infection in infants fits
into one of the following three categories:
· Rapid progressors who are likely to have acquired the infec -
tion in utero or during early perinatal period. These usually
die within the first year of life and constitute from 25-30%;
112 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
· Children who develop symptoms early in life then deteriorate
and die at the age of between 3-5 years. These constitute about
50-60%;
· Long term survivors who live beyond 8 years who constitute
between 5-25%.
There are age specific differences in immunologic markers of
disease, virological pattern and clinical manifestation of HIV
infection between adults and children. The HIV viral load
(VL) is relatively higher in children than in adults, most likely
because of the inability of the infant's immature immune system
to contain viral replication as well as the presence of a greater
number of HIV susceptible cells in the expanding lymphoid mass
during infancy. In this regard, the prognosis of HIV infection in
children is worse than in adults. In the absence of HAART, one
third of children who acquire HIV through vertical transmission
die during the first year, another third die during the second and
third year, and the remaining third survive for up to 15 years.
Unlike in adults, in children there are age-specific differences in the
immunologic markers of disease, virological pattern and clinical
manifestation of HIV infection. The basic effect of HIV on the
immune system is CD4 cell depletion and dysfunction. Absolute
CD4 count is higher in healthy children than in adults and the
CD4 count varies with age and slowly declines to adult levels by the
age of 6 years. Therefore measurement of the CD4 percent is the
preferred immunologic marker for monitoring disease progression
in younger children rather than absolute CD4 count.

number of HIV susceptible cells in the expanding lymphoid mass
during infancy. In that connection, the prognosis of HIV infection
in children is worse than in adults. In the absence of ARVs, one
third of children who acquire HIV through vertical transmission
die in the first year, another third die in the second and third year,
and the remaining third survive for between 3 to 15 years.
Diagnosis of HIV Infection in Infants
All infants born of HIV-infected women have passively transferred
antibodies that persist until 9 to 18 months of age. These passively
transferred maternal HIV antibodies make interpretation of
positive antibody tests difficult in children below 18 months of
age. Assays that detect the virus or its components (i.e. virologic
tests) are required in order to positively diagnose HIV infection
in children <18 months of age. The two most commonly used
tests for such a diagnosis are DNA PCR or RNA PCR. However,
DNA PCR is the preferred method of choice.
PCR tests should be done at 4-6 weeks or at the second MCH
visit (i.e. eight weeks after delivery):
· For a child that was never breastfed: A single negative PCR
test after the age of 4 weeks excludes HIV infection.
· For a child that was weaned for more than 6 weeks prior to
virologic (DNA PCR) testing, a negative PCR test excludes
HIV infection.
· If the child is being breastfed, a negative virologic test does
not exclude infection. On-going exposure to HIV through
breastfeeding continues to put the child at risk of infection.
Confirmatory testing should be done 6 weeks after a complete
ceassation of breastfeeding as described above to determine
final infection status.
114 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
Children between the ages of 9 and 18 months at the first health
encounter should have a rapid HIV antibody test since maternal
HIV antibodies diminish rapidly between 9-18 months of age. All
positive tests should be confirmed with a DNA PCR test. If the
antibody test is negative and the infant is still breastfeeding, the
antibody test should be repeated at least 6 weeks after complete
cessation of breastfeeding. However, if the child is symptomatic,
fulfilling WHO stage 3 or 4 criteria and virological tests are not
available but HIV antibodies are present, a presumptive diagnosis
should be made and ART started.
A presumptive diagnosis of severe HIV disease should be made if:
· An infant < 18 months has an HIV antibody test positive
AND:
· Has diagnosis of any AIDS-indicator condition(s)  OR
· Symptomatic with two or more of the following:
- Oral thrush
- Severe pneumonia
- Severe sepsis
· Other factors that support the diagnosis include:
- Recent HIV-related maternal death
- Advanced HIV disease in the mother
- CD4< 25%
The HIV status should be confirmed as soon as possible.
Presumptive diagnosis should NOT be done in children >18
months old. In these infants HIV infection must be confirmed
or excluded using widely available antibody tests.
For details see Annex 3 Presumptive and definitive criteria for
recognizing HIV/AIDS related clinical events in infants and
children with established HIV infection
115
HIV and AIDS Manifestations in Children
Clinical signs and symptoms of HIV infection are useful pa -
rameters in making an HIV diagnosis, but in children, these
features sometimes overlap with those of other common child -
hood diseases and are therefore more reliable in children with
severe clinical diseases.
Signs/conditions specific to HIV infection
· Pneumocystis pneumonia
· Oesophageal candidiasis
· Extrapulmonary cryptococcosis
· Invasive salmonella infection
· Lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis
· Herpes zoster (shingles) with multi-dermatomal involve -
ment
· Kaposi's sarcoma
· Lymphoma
· Progressive multifocal encephalopathy
Signs/conditions common in HIV-infected children and
uncommon in uninfected children
· Severe bacterial infections, particularly if recurrent
· Persistent or recurrent oral thrush
· Bilateral painless parotid enlargement
· Generalized persistent non-inguinal lymphadenopathy
· Hepatosplenomegaly (in non-malaria endemic areas)
· Persistent and/or recurrent fever
· Neurologic dysfunction
· Herpes zoster (shingles), single dermatome
· Persistent generalized dermatitis unresponsive to treatment
116 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
Signs/conditions common in HIV-infected children but also
common in uninfected children
· Chronic, recurrent otitis with ear discharge
· Persistent or recurrent diarrhoea
· Severe pneumonia
· Tuberculosis
· Bronchiectasis
· Failure to thrive
· Marasmus
Diagnosis using the Integrated Management of Childhood
Illnesses (IMCI) Algorithm
IMCI guidelines are a useful tool at the first level referral facility
to screen children with possible HIV infection who need to be
referred for HIV testing or that have the test performed and are
referred for care and treatment if they test positive.
The IMCI criterion includes symptoms suggestive of HIV in
which a child is classified as having symptomatic HIV infection
if the IMCI practitioner identifies any four of the following
symptoms:
· Recurrent pneumonia
· Oral thrush
· Persistent ear discharge
· Persistent diarrhoea
· Very low weight
· Enlarged lymph nodes
· Parotid enlargement
NB: IMCI criteria is not used to consider ARV initiation
117
WHO Paediatric Clinical Staging (see Annex 2)
The clinical stage is useful for assessment at baseline (first diag -
nosis of HIV infection), entry into long-term HIV care, and in
the follow-up of patients in care and treatment programmes. It
should be used to guide decisions on when to start cotrimoxazole
prophylaxis and other HIV-related interventions, including when
to start antiretroviral therapy. The clinical stages have been shown
to be related to survival, prognosis and progression of clinical
disease without antiretroviral therapy in adults and children.

Management of Infants Born to HIV Positive Women
The counselling of parents on the care of infants born to HIV
positive mothers is an essential component of the management
of HIV exposed children. Management strategies include:
· HIV diagnostic testing for both the mother and child
· Scheduled clinic visits for care
· Chemoprophylaxis with Cotrimoxazole, a fixed dose com -
bination of Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)
even if HIV status is unconfirmed
118 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
· Infants of HIV infected mothers should receive prophylactic
treatment against PCP and other opportunistic infections
using TMP-SMX from 4­6 weeks of age (or at first encounter
with the health care system if the child was not seen within
4­6 weeks of delivery), and continued until HIV infection
can be excluded. This should be given orally as per required
dosing (see paediatric dosing chart). TMP-SMX may need
to continue until 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding
when infection can be excluded.
· Mothers should be counselled on the advantages and disad -
vantages of breastfeeding, with particular attention to the risk
of breastfeeding for short or long duration, mixed feeding
and advantages of exclusive breast-feeding. (Please refer to
the Infant Feeding Guidelines in HIV and AIDS provided
in the PMTCT guidelines of the Ministry of Health and
Social Welfare).
· Care of the mother after delivery and during follow up
including treatment of opportunistic infections should also
be emphasized. Mothers should receive psychosocial support
through counselling in the postnatal period.
HIV Diagnostic Protocol for Abandoned Infants
In the absence of a mother, the guardian/care taker needs to be
counselled and the child started on co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.
In such a case, since the mother's HIV status is unknown, the
HIV exposure status of the baby will have to be established by
performing a rapid HIV antibody test and then PCR (if available)
at 6 weeks and again at 3 months if the antibody test is positive.
119
1. Immediately: Rapid test
2. At 6 weeks of age: HIV PCR
3. At 3 months of age: Repeat HIV PCR to confirm 6-8
week negative result
Notes:
1. AclinicalexaminationtoassessforsignsandsymptomsofHIV
infection should be performed during all visits, and especially
at 6 weeks and 3 months of age. Thereafter, the infant should
be followed up as per recommendations for all children.
2. Postnatal transmission of HIV infection is likely to be evident
by6weeksafterbreastfeedinghasbeenterminated.Nevertheless,
it is recommended that the final qualitative HIV PCR test on
abandoned infants be performed 3 months after breastfeeding
has ceased.
3. If PCR is unavailable, clinical monitoring and prophylaxis
should continue until the child reaches clinical stage III, upon
which ART can be started. HIV testing (EIA or rapid) should
be performed as soon as the child attains 12 months of age.
Care of HIV infected Children
· All children should be assessed for symptoms related to HIV
as well as the need for treatment and prophylaxis for op -
portunistic infections and other HIV related conditions.
· Baseline laboratory tests should be performed to establish
viral and immunological status whenever possible.
· A complete medical and immunization history should be
obtained, with particular emphasis on the suspected mode
of HIV transmission, history of ARV exposure (pre-, intra-,
post-partum, and during breastfeeding) and timing of HIV
120 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
diagnosis. Family members who are aware of the diagnosis
should also be known.
· HIV-infected children should receive routine paediatric
care and be monitored for their HIV disease status. At
each visit, a complete physical examination should be done
paying particular attention to signs commonly associated
with HIV infection ( e.g. adenopathy, hepatomegaly and
splenomegaly). Infants under the age of 1 year with PCR
confirmed HIV infection will need ARV therapy.
· Growth and development should be evaluated and charted
at all stages of development right through adolescence.
· The need for medication should be reviewed based on his -
tory, physical examination and laboratory findings.
· Doses of prophylactic or treatment medications should be
adjusted on the basis of growth and compliance and toler -
ability should be assessed at every visit.
· Medication plans (OI prophylaxis and ARV therapy) need
to be discussed intensively with parents or guardians. It is
advisable that one single person in the household is identified
as the consistent care provider responsible for dispensing
treatment to the child.
· HIV related care needs of parents or guardians themselves need
to be discussed and appropriate referrals made accordingly.
· ChildrenexposedtoARVsshouldbecloselymonitoredatevery
visit for signs of toxicity (i.e. clinical or laboratory indications)
andadverseeventsshouldbeproperlydocumentedandreported
to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.
Disclosure
Disclosure of the HIV status to the child should be discussed with
the parents or guardians. The process of disclosure can be done over
121
time, beginning when the child starts asking questions about the
disease or the medication he/she is taking or acting in a way that
suggests that he/she is feeling isolated from other children because
of the disease. Close coordination with the guardian/parent of
the chid in question is crucial. Usually, one can start mentioning
to a 4 ­ 6 years old HIV-infected child that they have a chronic
disease that requires regular clinic visits and medicines every day.
At about 8 ­ 10 years it is recommended that the issue of HIV and
AIDS be mentioned but in a caring and supportive manner and
environment. Before their early teen years HIV-infected children
should know that they are infected with HIV, how it is spread and
how to stay healthy. It has been shown that children cope better
with their HIV status when properly counselled. It is particularly
important that adolescents be informed of their HIV status so
that they can become active participants in their own care.
Clinical Manifestations of Paediatric HIV Infection
Respiratory Conditions in Children with HIV Infection
Pneumonia and chronic lung diseases contribute to the increased
morbidity and mortality of HIV-infected children. It is difficult
to differentiate between different respiratory conditions that
are often fatal in immune compromised children. The most
common respiratory conditions include:
Bacterial Pneumonias
Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
Staphylococcus aureus, and gram negative bacteria such as Klebsiella
pneumoniae.
Clinical Presentation
· History of fever, cough and fast breathing (tachypnoea)
· With or without signs of severe pneumonia (chest indrawing,
122 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
cyanosis and lethargy)
· On auscultation of the chest one hears unilateral or bilateral
crepitations (crackles), decreased breath sounds or bronchial
breathing (lobar pneumonia)
When pulse oximetry is available it will demonstrate hypoxia
(02 saturation less than 95%).
Diagnosis
· Complete blood counts; raised white blood cells (WBC)
with a neutrophilia suggest bacterial pneumonia.
· Because symptoms of pneumonia and malaria often overlap,
in malaria endemic areas remember to do a malarial smear
and treat for malaria if indicated. Where blood cultures can
be done they may assist in identifying the causative agent
· A chest x-ray is not necessary for diagnosis of acute pneumo -
nia but may be useful in ruling out complications or other
pulmonary conditions.
· Sputum induction and nasopharyngeal aspirate may assist
in the diagnosis of PCP or TB.
Management at outpatient level
· Oral amoxicillin or penicillin is adequate.
· Where the child is already on Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis CTX
should not be used to treat pneumonia unless PCP is suspected.
If PCP is suspected then high dose CTX should be used.
· If the child is under one year of age the risk of PCP is very
high and should be considered.
· Give Paracetamol for fever.
Management of Severe Pneumonia
Severe pneumonia should be managed in hospital and should
include both supportive and specific therapy.
123
Supportive Care
· Pulse oximeter is critical for the assessment of 02 satura -
tion and the need for supplemental oxygen where the child
presents with chest indrawing, cyanosis or hypoxia.
· Ensure adequate hydration (either IV or oral depending on
the severity) and monitor.
· Remember to give paracetamol for fever and pain.
Specific therapy:
· Use Chloramphenicol or Ceftriaxone/Cefotaxime (3rd
generation) if available.
· Use Ampicillin/Cloxacillin and Gentamicin as alternatives.  
· Antibiotic therapy for HIV-infected children needs to be
longer 7-14 days.
· If the child is under one year, PCP must be considered as a
possible diagnosis and treatment with high dose cotrimox -
azole and steroids prescribed.
· If an infant presents with severe pneumonia they should be
treated for both bacterial pneumonia and PCP and investi -
gated for possible HIV.
· Children treated for PCP should continue on PCP prophy -
laxis until the diagnosis of HIV exposure or infection has
been excluded.
· If pneumonia is associated with typical Staphylococcal skin
lesions, a positive blood culture for staphylococcus aureus, and
poor response to 1st line antibiotics, and if the child just had
measles, consider staphylococcal pneumonia. A chest x-ray
(if available) will show very small cavities (pneumatoceles).
For such children, treatment should also include Cloxacillin
or Vancomycin.
124 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonitis (LIP)
LIP usually occurs in children more than two years of age.
Clinical Symptoms
· Chronic cough
· Cyanosis
· Digital clubbing
· Difficulty in breathing and terminal hypoxia
· Associated with parotitis, generalised Lymphadenopathy
and hepatosplenomegaly
· Poor response to TB therapy
Radiological Picture
· Diffuse bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates may appear
similar to miliary TB
· May develop consolidation, cystic lesions; bilateral hilar or
mediastinal lymph node enlargement
· Particularly difficult to differentiate from TB
Management
It is particularly difficult to differentiate from TB management.
· Steroids are needed when children with LIP have significant
respiratory distress
· Prednisone 2 mg/kg/day - initially for 4 weeks daily and
then alternate day maintenance for 2-3 months and review
· Oxygen therapy during episodes of hypoxia
· Bronchodilators like salbutamol where wheezing is a prob -
lem
· Antibiotics are needed during episodes of concurrent super
infection with pneumonia
· Chest physiotherapy and postural drainage if there is second -
ary Bronchiectasis
125
· Supportive care includes correction of anaemia especially
iron supplementation
· Antiretroviral therapy as specific therapy
· Refer for specialist care if resistant to therapy
Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia (PCP)
PCPisthemajorcauseofseverepneumoniaanddeathinHIVinfected
infants. Incidence is highest during the first year of life and usually
peaks at 3 to 6 months of age. Infants are usually in a good nutrition
state and may have no clinical features that indicate the presence of
HIV. However, it may be the first AIDS defining illness.
Clinical features
· No fever or low grade
· Marked respiratory distress (chest indrawing, cyanosis, in -
ability to drink)
· On auscultation one hears clear chest or diffuse fine crepita -
tions
· Poor response to standard antibiotic treatment
· With pulse oximetry severe persistent hypoxia (paO2 < 90%)
will be demonstrated
· They may have other signs of HIV including splenomegaly,
oral thrush, lymphadenopathy and weight loss
Investigations
· The mainstay of PCP diagnosis in Tanzania is mainly clinical
therefore, where there is a high index of suspicion, clinicians
should promptly initiate therapy along with treatment for
bacterial pneumonia
· A chest x-ray may show hyperinflation, diffuse infiltrates or
normal
· Sputum induction with nasopharyngeal aspirate stained
126 Chapter 7: Pediatric HIV and AIDS-related Conditions
with Giemsa or Silver stain or Immunofluorescent stain
· Bronchoalveolar lavage where available can also be used to
produce a specimen for staining
Management of PCP
Supportive:
· Oxygen therapy
· Maintain and monitor hydration
· Paracetamol for pain
· Continue therapy for bacterial pneumonia
· Nutrition support
Specific:
· High dose Cotrimoxazole (CTX) IV  20mg/kg TMP/day
given every 6 hours for 21 days
· Oral cotrimoxazole at the same dose may also be used if IV
not available
· Prednisone at 2mg/kg/day for 7-14 day (taper if  more than
7 days)
· Secondary prophylaxis using cotrimoxazole after an acute
episode of PCP
· All children younger than one year of age documented to be
living with HIV should receive cotrimoxazole prophylaxis
regardless of symptoms or CD4 percentage.
· After one year of age, initiation of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is
recommendedforsymptomaticchildren(WHOclinicalstages

Chapter 8: Antiretroviral
Therapy in Adults and
Adolescents
Introduction
Since 1996, when more extensive use of potent antiretroviral
therapy for HIV started, there has been a significant improvement
in the safety and tolerability of regimens used for initial treatment.
The pill burden and dosing frequency have been reduced and
short-term and long-term adverse events minimized; all of which
have contributed to the success rates in initial treatment.
The past few years have seen dramatic advances in the development
of ARVs, which now offers extended patient survival and improved
quality of life. New medications including protease inhibitors (PIs)
and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
combined with older nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NRTIs) have increased the potential to reduce HIV replication.
Therapeutic regimens may be directed at one or several of the
replication sites in the life cycle of the virus.
Types of Antiretroviral Drugs
The currently existing and commercially available antiretroviral
drugs fall into the following five main categories:
1. Binding and Fusion Inhibitors
2. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
3. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
4. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Nucleotide
analogues)
5. Protease inhibitors (Pls)
132 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
Binding and Fusion Inhibitors
Fusion inhibitors prevent HIV from entering target cells. Drugs
of this class bind to the HIV envelope protein gp41, which is
involved in viral entry. These are a new class of antiretroviral drugs
(e.g. Enfuvirtide) that are currently not available in Tanzania.
Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
(NRTIs)
This was the first group of drugs to be used and was the mainstay
of antiretroviral therapy in the country. The primary mechanism
of action of this class is inhibition of viral RNA-dependent DNA
polymerase (reverse transcriptase) enzyme. The drugs that are
available in Tanzania under this class include:
· Zidovudine (AZT)
· Stavudine (d4T)
· Lamivudine (3TC)
· Abacavir (ABC)
· Emtricitabine (FTC)  
· Didanosine (ddI)
Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
(NNRTIs)
Similar to the NRTIs, NNRTIs also act by disrupting the reverse
transcription of viral RNA into DNA which is then incorporated
in the cell's nucleus. However, unlike the NRTIs, they are not
directly incorporated into the viral DNA; instead they inhibit
replication directly by binding to the enzyme reverse transcriptase.
Resistance to these drugs develops rapidly, especially when used
alone. Drugs under this class that are available in Tanzania are
Nevirapine (NVP) and Efavirenz (EFV).
133
Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors
(Nucleotide analogues)
Nucleotide analogues resemble monophosphorylated nucleosides,
and therefore require only two additional phosphorylations to
become active inhibitors of DNA synthesis. An example of this
relatively new class of antiretroviral drugs is Tenofovir (TDF).
Protease Inhibitors (PIs)
PIs competitively inhibit the HIV protease enzyme whose activity
is critical for the terminal maturation of infectious virions. This
inhibition prevents the maturation of virions capable of infecting
other cells. Drugs available in Tanzania that fall under this class are
Lopinavir (LPV), Ritonavir (RTV) and Atazanavir (ATV).
Treatment Using ARV Drugs in Adults and
Adolescents
From the moment a patient tests HIV-positive, he/she should
be referred to the CTC. The initial management requires a
complete assessment of the patient starting with WHO clinical
staging. Thereafter the following tests should be done:
· Complete blood count
· Renal test (through urinalysis)
· Liver function tests
· Urine for pregnancy test (if pregnancy is possible)
· CD4 T-lymphocytes count
· Viral load (where available and indicated)
Treatmentdecisionsshouldbebasedontheextentofclinicaldisease
progressionandreadinessofthepatient.Thegoldstandardforevalu -
ating immune function remains to be CD4+ T lymphocyte counts.
The determination of viral load has more of a prognostic value and
is routinely used in clinical practice in developed countries.
134 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
Thetestsmentionedabove,whenavailable,shouldbedoneatbaseline
and as needed for clinical care (e.g. in cases of toxicity), and at least
every six months for patients on treatment.
Criteria of Initiation of ART in Adults and
Adolescents Patients
Despite a theoretical benefit to antiretroviral therapy for patients
with high CD4 counts, there are major dilemmas confronting
patients and practitioners when ART is initiated too early. The
currently available antiretroviral regimens that have the greatest
potency in terms of viral suppression and CD4+ T-lymphocytes
preservation are medically complex, are associated with a number
of specific side effects and drug interactions, and pose a substantial
challenge for adherence. Also, the development of mutations
associated with drug resistance can make therapy less effective
or ineffective in the future. In this regard, decisions regarding
treatment of asymptomatic, chronically infected individuals
with high CD4 counts must balance a number of competing
factors that influence risk and benefit.
On the other hand, the treatment of patients with WHO Stage
4 disease (clinical AIDS) should not be dependent on their CD4
cell count. Any individual in Stage 4 should be started on ART
immediately. For patients with Stage 3 disease, the upper limit
of 350cells/mm3 has been selected and such patients are eligible
for treatment. (See Annex 1: WHO clinical staging for adults
and adolescents).
Patients with a CD4 cell count of <200/mm3 should also be
started on treatment, regardless of the clinical stage.
There are therefore 3 classes of patients that are eligible to begin
treatment:
135
· All patients in WHO stage 4 clinical criteria, regardless of
CD4 cell count
· Patients in WHO Stage 3 with a CD4 cell count <350/mm3
as an indicator of their progression to AIDS
· All patients with a CD4 count < 200cells/mm3, regardless
of clinical symptoms
Figure 8.1: Criteria for ART in Adults and Adolescents
136 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
Beyond medical eligibility, it is important to adherently assess
and address a patient's willingness, readiness and ability to be
on ART. Psychosocial considerations (not exclusion criteria)
need to be evaluated before initiation of therapy during several
(at least more than one) pre-treatment visits, and strengthened
in subsequent visits. These include:
· Demonstrated reliability, i.e. has attended three or more
scheduled visits to an HIV clinic
· No evidence of active alcohol or other substance abuse that
could affect adherence
· No untreated active depression
It is strongly recommended that clients to be initiated on ART
should have disclosed their HIV status to at least one friend or
family member who will become their adherence assistant (AA)
and, if possible, the client should join a support group.
Clients need to have accepted their HIV positive status and be
clear on the consequences of HIV infection, the role of ART,
and the need to strictly adhere to the treatment plan before
commencing therapy.
Clients also need to be able to attend the CTC on a regular basis
or have access to services that will enable them to maintain the
treatment chain. Transport may need to be arranged for patients
in rural areas or for those who live far from the treatment site.
Evaluation to be done before initiating therapy
Before initiating therapy in any patient, a good history of the
patient must be taken and a top-to-toe physical examination
conducted. Thereafter, the following baseline laboratory tests
should be done:
137
· Urinalysis
· A complete blood count
· Chemistry profile for liver (serum alanine aminotransferase,
ALT)
· Tests to rule out active TB where indicated (sputum AFB,
CXR)
· CD 4 count
The following could be done if available:
· Serum creatinine and lipids
· Hepatitis B and C serology
· Viral load
The patient and other family members ( with patients' consent)
should then be educated on HIV/AIDS and the need to adhere
to the agreed treatment plan.
General orientation of the patient and family members should
include:
· Who to call and where to get refills
· Who to call and where to go when clinical problems arise
· Who to call/where to go for assistance on social, spiritual
and legal problems that might interfere with adherence to
treatment
Goals of Therapy
The principal aim of antiretroviral therapy is to prevent morbidity
and mortality in people with HIV/AIDS by suppressing viremia
and thereby restoring immune capacity. The disease upper limit
at which the benefits of therapy outweigh the risks has been
debated for as long as antiretrovirals have been available.
138 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
Benefits of Delaying Therapy
· For PLHAs whose short-term risk of disease progression is low,
HighlyActivatedAnti-retroviralTherapy(HAART)mayreduce
the quality of life because of potential toxicity and pill burden.
· PLHAs who delay starting treatment may be better prepared
to adhere to therapy when they do start.
· Delayed initiation of ART may delay the emergence of drug
resistance if treatment fails thereby ensuring that other treat -
ment options remain available for use later in the course of
the disease.
· Delaying therapy initiation also postpones the cost of treatment.
Benefits of Earlier Therapy
· Early intervention may allow preservation of immune ca -
pacity at a level that may not be fully restored if treatment
is started late thus resulting into a prolonged disease-free
survival over a longer period of time.
· Virologic failure may be less likely if treatment is started earlier
while HIV-1 RNA is relatively low hence less detrimental
patterns of viral evolution.
· Transmission of HIV may be prevented through earlier treat -
ment initiation by reducing viremia at the population level.
· Earlier therapy initiation may also be more cost-effective
than delayed treatment.
The eradication of HIV infection cannot be achieved with
currently available antiretroviral regimens. This is due to the
establishment of a pool of latently infected CD4+ T-lymphocyte
cells during the very early stages of acute HIV infection, that
persists with an extremely long half-life even with prolonged
suppression of plasma viraemia to <50 copies/L.
139
The primary goals of antiretroviral therapy are:
· Maximal and durable suppression of viral load
· Restoration and/or preservation of immunologic function
· Improvement of quality of life
· Reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality
Secondary goals are to decrease the incidence of HIV through
· Increased uptake of voluntary testing and counselling with
more people knowing their status and practicing safer sex
· The reduction of transmission in discordant couples, and
· Reducing the risks of HIV transmission from mother to child
In order to achieve these goals the following strategies should
be used:
· Adequatecounsellingandcreationofasupportiveenvironmentfor
patients to maximize adherence to the antiretroviral regimens
· Rational sequencing of drugs for the preservation of future
treatment options
· Monitoring of drug resistance in selected clinical settings   
· Monitoring of toxicities and adverse drug reactions
It is important that prescribers are clear about when to start
antiretroviral drugs as described above. They also need to know
which drugs to use in which order, when to change therapy, and
which alternative drugs to use when changing therapy.
Recommended ARV Drugs in Tanzania
Introduction
The use of monotherapy in the treatment of HIV infection is
not recommended. Antiretroviral therapy both in naïve patients
and those who have received treatment before involves the use
140 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
of a combination of drugs. Triple therapy consisting of 2 NRTI
+ 1 NNRTI or 2 NRTI + 1 PI or 3 NRTI's is recommended. It is
important to remember that there is no single combination that is
best for every patient and/or that can be tolerated by all patients.
Regimens should be recommended on the basis of a patient's
clinical condition, lifestyle, and ability to tolerate the regimen.
First Line ARV Combination Regimen for Adults
and Adolescent ART Naive Patients
The MoHSW recommends the following drugs for first line
treatment:
· Zidovudine (AZT)
· Stavudine (d4T)
· Lamivudine  (3TC)
· Emtricitabine  (FTC)
· Tenofovir  (TDF)
· Nevirapine (NVP)
· Efavirenz (EFV)  
The following drug combinations can be made out of these drugs
for adults and adolescents, and should be used according to
indications and contraindications that govern the use of ARVs
to minimize side effects and drug-drug interactions.
· AZT+3TC+NVP
· AZT+ 3TC+EFV
· d4T+3TC+NVP  
· d4T+3TC+EFV
· TDF+FTC+EFV
· TDF+FTC +NVP
· TDF+3TC+EFV
· TDF+3TC+NVP
141
Note: The following drugs may appear in fixed drug combina -
tions (FDC):
· AZT+3TC, e.g. Combivir or Duovir
· AZT+3TC+NVP, e.g. Duovir N
· d4T+3TC+NVP, e.g. Triomune
· TDF+FTC+EFV, e.g. Atripla
· TDF+3TC
· TDF+FTC, e.g. Truvada
The default first line regimen in Tanzania is:
Zidovudine (AZT) 300 mg/Lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg twice
daily and Efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg once daily at night.
For women in the child bearing age, Nevirapine (NVP)
200 mg twice a day is given instead of Efavirenz.
Note:
· For young adolescents, the dose of AZT is 200 mg BD for
a body weight of between 20-25 kgs.
· For patients with <40kg, the dose of EFV should be
<600 mg.
· Efavirenz has been reported to be associated with teratoge -
nicity in early pregnancy. In this case, Nevirapine should be
prescribed instead.
· In women for whom effective contraception can be assured,
EFV remains a viable option for the NNRTI component of
the regimen.
See also annex 4, Dosages of Antiretroviral drugs for Adults and
Adolescents.
The AZT+3TC+EFV combination is the default combination
to be prescribed to all patients if there is no contraindication.
142 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
Figure 8.2: Recommended First line drug regimen in Tanzania
Under certain circumstances however, the following regimens
can be used as first line:
· Zidovudine (AZT)+Lamivudine(3TC)+Nevirapine (NVP)
This regimen can be prescribed when Efavirenz is contraindi -
cated, such as in Neuropsychiatric complications of Efevirenz
and pregnancy or when stavudine can not be used such as
in the presence of peripheral neuropathy.
Note: Nevirapine challenge dosing is required during the begin -
ning of treatment. In the first two weeks of treatment only half
of the required daily dose of Nevirapine should be given, and a
full dose if there are no side effects such as skin rash or hepatic
toxicity. (Repeat ALT at two weeks). In summary, this means:
(Zidovudine 300 mg/Lamivudine 150 mg/Nevirapine 200 mg
in the morning + Zidovudine 300 mg/Lamivudine 150 mg. in
the evening for the first 2 weeks. And if there are no problems,
THEN Zidovudine 300 mg/Lamivudine 150 mg/Nevirapine
200 mg twice daily).
143
· Stavudine (d4T)+Lamivudine (3TC)+Efavirenz (EFV)
This regimen can be given when Zidovudine is contraindi -
cated, such as in the presence of anaemia, or concomitant
use of anti-TB therapy where Nevirapine can not be used.
· Stavudine (d4T) +Lamivudine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)
Thisregimencanbeusedwhenthereissignificantanaemiaanduse
ofEfavirenziscontraindicated(e.g.forapregnantwomanwhois
also anaemic). Nevirapine challenge dosing is required as above.
· Tenofovir (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Efavirenz (EFV)
· Tenofovir (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Nevirapine
(NVP)
· Tenofovir (TDF) + Lamuvidine (3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV)
· Tenofovir (TDF) + Lamuvidine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)
The above 4 regimens which contain TDF are indicated when
a patient can not use both Stavudine and Zidovudine, for ex -
ample in the case of both severe anaemia and severe peripheral
neuropathy.   However, the major concern with Tenofovir-based
treatment is renal safety. Tenofovir-associated nephrotoxicity is
especially likely in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction
or those receiving other concomitant nephrotoxins. Otherwise
the overall rate of discontinuation for renal events is extremely
low. Renal function should be monitored through routine urine
testing for the occurrence of proteinuria and if available serum
ceatinine.
In cases where Nevirapine or Efavirenz cannot be used as a first
line drug, a single drug from the second line drugs can be used;
for example LPV/r or ABC.
Note: The use of Tenofovir or a second line drug with first
line drugs should be decided by clinicians with experience
in managing HIV with various regimens. Therefore, patients
144 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
whose condition requires such decisions should be referred to
to hospitals with such expertise.
ART in Women of Childbearing Potential or
Pregnant Women
The guiding principle for the treatment of women of childbear -
ing potential or pregnant women is that therapeutic decisions
should be based solely on their need and eligibility for ART.
The recommended first-line regimen for this patient subgroup
is: AZT + 3TC + NVP. However, special circumstances of
pregnancy or breast-feeding raise additional issues concerning
toxicity to mothers and children, the choice of ARV drugs, and
the prevention of HIV transmission from mothers to infants.
While d4T might be necessary as a substitute for AZT, close
monitoring should be done because of the increased risk of the
development of lactic acidosis due to d4T use.
Women who are receiving ART and become pregnant should
continue their treatment unless they are in the first trimester of
pregnancy and EFV has been part of the regimen, in which case,
EFV should be discontinued and replaced by NVP.
Note: ARV drugs have the potential to either decrease or increase
the bioavailability of steroid hormones in hormonal contracep -
tives. Thus, if a woman on ARV treatment decides to initiate
or continue hormonal contraceptive use, the consistent use of
condoms must be recommended for preventing HIV transmis -
sion. This may also compensate for any possible reduction in
the effectiveness of the hormonal contraceptive.
Antiretroviral Drugs for non-ART Naïve Patients
Treatment for patients who have been previously exposed to
145
antiretroviral therapy should be discussed with an antiretroviral
expert before they are enrolled in the CTC and (re)started on
treatment. Generally:
· Patients that are controlled on their antiretroviral medication
at appropriate doses should continue on the same regimen
if possible.
· Those who stopped for reasons other than treatment failure
and for whom failure is not suspected, can restart the original
regimen.
· Those known or suspected to have failed a previous regimen
should be started on drugs they have not been exposed to
before as appropriate.
Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy
Adherence to ART is an essential component of treatment
success. Adherence rates of >95% are needed to maximize the
benefits of ART. Achieving such high rates over a long period of
time is a challenge; therefore different approaches to improving
adherence should be sought and tailored to the patient's lifestyle
through proper counselling and health education (see chapter 12
on adherence counselling).
Factors That Influence Adherence
The following predictors of good adherence to HIV medications
have been identified:
· Availability of emotional and practical life support, including
the assigning a treatment assistant at home
· Patients' ability to fit the medications into their daily routine
· Patients' understanding that poor adherence leads to resistance
development and may limit future treatment options
· The recognition that taking all medication doses is important
146 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
· Patients feeling comfortable to take their medication in a
variety of settings including in public
· Availability of a clinic capable of monitoring treatment
· Keeping clinic appointments
Strategies That Enhance Adherence
There are three main categories of strategies that those caring
for HIV patients must be aware of to facilitate improvement
and sustain adherence to treatment with ARVs. Below are the
different strategies and their applicability:
(i) Patient related strategies
· Health care workers should negotiate a treatment plan that
the patient understands and to which he/she commits.
· A patient's "readiness" to be on life-long medication should
be clearly established.
· Patients must understand that the first ART regimen has
the best chance of long-term success.
· Family members should be recruited to become participants
in the treatment plan.
(ii) Clinician and health team related strategies should include
· Building a trusting relationship with patients
· Adopting provider attitudes and behaviours that are sup -
portive and non-judgmental to encourage patients to be
honest about their adherence and about problems they have
with adherence.
· Monitoring and encouraging adherence at every clinical
encounter.
· Explaining possible side effects when initiating treatment.
147
(iii) Regimen-related strategies
· Regimens should be simplified by reducing the number of
pills and the frequency of taking drugs
· Drug interactions and side effects should be minimized
through rational drug selection
· Differences between medication requirements (e.g. with
food, without food, etc.) should be minimized
Changing Antiretroviral Therapy
There are multiple reasons which may prompt the need to
change antiretroviral therapy. These can be grouped into two
major categories:
Drug adverse events ­ Toxicities, including:
· Intolerable side effects
· Drug interactions
· During pregnancy if the patient is on EFV
Treatment failure including:
· Clinical failure ­ occurrence or persistence of HIV related
OIs
· Immunological failure
· Virological failure
There are no studies or reliable estimates of the number of days,
weeks, or months that represent a clinically important inter -
ruption of one or more components of a therapeutic regimen
that would increase the likelihood of drug resistance. If there
is a need to discontinue any antiretroviral medication for an
extended period, clinicians and patients should be advised of
the theoretical advantage of stopping all antiretroviral agents
simultaneously, rather than continuing one or two agents, to
148 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
minimize the emergence of resistant viral strains. However, with
regimens containing Nevirapine, dual therapy should continue
for a week after stopping Nevirapine.
Changing Antiretroviral Therapy Due to Toxicity
From a clinical perspective, it is generally recommended that
when changing a patient's regimen due to toxicity, only the
toxic drug(s) should be replaced, if possible. Table 8.3 below
provides guidance on ARV drug combinations with some com -
mon toxicity switches. It is based on the first line drugs in the
National ARV Program.

***Follow renal functions closely.
Severity of Adverse Events Due to ARVs
Side effects or toxicities caused by ARVs can be classified into
three broad categories:
149
First category: Symptoms are mild and transient and often
require patient assurance that these symptoms are common
and will decrease over time. These can be mild headaches,
mild gastric upset, nausea, fatigue and the CNS disturbances
particularly with EFV. ARV interruption is seldom indicated
in this situation.
Second category: Symptoms are somewhat more severe and
often respond to some medical intervention. They include
more severe gastric upset with nausea and vomiting, more
severe headaches and mild peripheral neuropathy that does
not incapacitate or interfere with a patient's lifestyle. These
symptoms can often be successfully treated with anti-emetics,
anti-diarrhoea medicines, analgesics, neuroleptics (e.g.
Amitriptylin) and other medicines. ARV interruption is
usually not indicated in this situation and often symptom -
atic treatment is only temporary. The mild rash associated
with NVP (dealt with under a separate paragraph below)
can often be treated with medical intervention.
Third category: Symptoms are severe such that ARV drugs
must be stopped and replaced by an alternative drug. These
include anaemia (haemoglobin < 7.5 gm/dl or a falling hae -
moglobin, that often drops by 2 gm/dl) as can occur with the
use of AZT. Severe symptoms noted in the first two categories
can sometimes lead to the stopping of ARV due to severe
toxicities such as nausea with severe discomfort and minimal
intake for 3 or more days, vomiting all intake in 24 hours or
dehydration due to vomiting, severe headache not responsive
to non-narcotic analgesics, or fatigue reducing activity by more
than 50%. In these situations, one or more ARVs should be
replaced by another.
150 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
This also includes the hypersensitivity reaction to NVP which
can include a severe rash or liver function test (LFT) elevations
to grade III or >5 times the upper limit of normal range.
NVP Hypersensitivity Reactions
NVP hypersensitivity reactions can manifest as a rash and/or
elevated LFTs. The rash can occur in up to 20% of patients
and usually occurs in the first 6-8 weeks of therapy. NVP will
be initiated at a lower dose for the first 2 weeks when only one
NVP dose is given per day for 14 days. If there are no clinical
signs or symptoms of a NVP hypersensitivity or allergy, the LFT
(ALAT) will be checked and the NVP dose will be escalated to
2 doses per day starting at the second week.
There are commonly two levels of severity in NVP-induced rashes.
i) Mild NVP hypersensitivity reaction
A mild rash is defined as erythema, urticaria, intact skin,
no blistering or sloughing of skin or desquamation, no
involvement of mucous membranes, no angioedema, and
no systemic signs (body aches, arthralgias, myalgias, fevers,
lymphadenopathy or significantly elevated LFTs). If a mild
drug-reaction type rash occurs, patients will continue treat -
ment with caution and careful monitoring. LFTs that are less
than grade III (<5 times the upper limit of normal) can usu -
ally be followed until it is resolved. This rash will be treated
with patient assurance, antihistamines and close follow up
until resolved. NVP dose escalation will be delayed for up
to one week until symptoms disappear. If symptoms worsen,
this may indicate that the patient has severe hypersensitivity
reaction and NVP will have to be stopped immediately and
other medical interventions considered.
151
ii) Severe NVP hypersensitivity reaction (Stevens-Johnson syn-
drome, SJS):
A severe rash is defined as severe erythema, urticaria, moisten -
ing of skin (desquamation), skin blistering, sloughing of skin,
exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme (when severe and
involving the mucous membranes known as SJS), anaphylaxis,
involvement of mucous membranes, angioedema, cracked/fis -
sured lips, or systemic signs (body aches, arthalgias, myalgias,
fevers, lymphadenopathy or significantly elevated LFTs). If a
severe drug-reaction type rash occurs, patients will discontinue
NVP treatment, begin high dose prednisolone, antihistamines,
analgesics, and be admitted to the hospital for IV fluids and
careful monitoring. LFTs can be grade III (>5 times the upper
limit of normal) or higher. NVP will be stopped immediately
and not re-introduced. All ARVs will be stopped. Once the
patientrecovers,3ARVdrugswillbestartedthatdonotinclude
NVP. The remaining 2 ARVs will be paired with a replacement
ARV such as EFV, if not contraindicated.
ABC (Abacavir) Hypersensitivity
ABC hypersensitivity occurs in 3-5% of patients and can be fatal.
Hypersensitivity symptoms include: flu symptoms, shortness
of breath, cough, fever, aches and pains, a general ill feeling,
fatigue/tiredness, swelling, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea,
muscle or joint aches, numbness, sore throat or rash. ABC will
be stopped immediately and not re-started if this occurs.
Note: If there is a history of ABC hypersensitivity, then ABC
is contraindicated.
EFV (Efavirenz) Side Effects
EFV can cause CNS side effects such as vivid dreams, nightmares,
152 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
vertigo, or confusion. These symptoms are often mild and tran -
sient. Patients may benefit from assurance that these symptoms
are common and will decrease over time.
d4T (Stavudine) Side Effects
Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect with the use of
Stavudine and occurrence of lactic acidosis has been reported.
These need to be carefully monitored.
Changing Antiretroviral Therapy Due to
Treatment Failure
Treatment failure can be virologic, immunologic and/or clini -
cal. It results from failure to suppress viral replication with the
development of viral resistance.
Virological Failure is defined as:
· Primary virologic failure if there a less than 10 fold drop in
viral load after 6-8 weeks of therapy, or when the viral load
(VL) is persistently above 10,000 copies/ml.
· Secondary virologic failure if there is a 10-fold increase of
VL from lowest recorded level.
Immunologic failure is defined as a:
· 50% drop in CD4 count from peak value within 6 months, or
· return to pre-ART baseline CD4 count or lower   
Clinical failure results in new disease progression which clinically
may present with development of clinical stage 4 opportunistic
infections or malignancy occurring 6 months or more after initia -
tion of ART.
In Tanzania, immunological and clinical parameters are used to
153
identify treatment failure. However, in light of declining costs of
performing viral load measurements, along with the simplification
of processes, where available, viral load parameters should also
be applied. Furthermore, clinical failure must be distinguished
from the Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome
(IRIS), in that, while clinical failure is associated with failing
CD4 counts, IRIS is associated with improvements in immune
response, i.e. CD4 counts.
Second-Line ARV Regimen
Before treatment failure is presumed and a particular regimen
discarded, every effort should be made to rule out causes other
than drug resistance. Patients should be evaluated for correct -
able factors, such as:
· Inappropriate dosing schedules
· Drug interactions that may reduce the efficacy of some of
the ARV
· Non adherence due to side effects
· Evidence of malabsorption
Each of the above scenarios could result in sub-therapeutic drug
levels and poor clinical response. In such cases, the regimen in
question may be salvaged with palliative medication and/or
patient education. If clinical assessment indicates the presence
of treatment failure due to confirmed drug resistance, the best
approach is to switch to an entirely new regimen, choosing two
or more drugs to which the patient is naïve as the second line
drug regimen. Before changing to the second line drug regimen,
the patient needs to go through the treatment readiness and
education process again. This needs to be carefully monitored
as some patients might hide their non-adherence.
154 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
Second-line Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults
and Adolescents
Drugs used as the second line drugs in Tanzania include:
NRTIs · Abacavir (ABC)
· Didanosine (ddI)
· Tenofovir with lamivudine or emtricitabine     
 (TDF + 3TC or FTC)
PIs · Lopinavir boosted by Ritonavir (LPV/r)
· Atazanavir boosted by Ritonavir (ATV/r)
The second line NRTI choice for adults and adolescents depends
on the first line regimen. For patients on AZT or d4T in first
line, the default second line option is to use is TDF plus 3TC
or FTC combined with a ritonavir-boosted PI, either LPV/r or
ATV/r. (TDF+3TC or FTC +LPV/r or ATV/r)
For patients who were initiated on TDF in first line because of
intolerance to AZT and d4T, the default second line option is to
use ABC plus ddI combined with a ritonavir-boosted PI, either
LPV/r or ATV/r. (ABC + ddI + LPV/r or ATV/r)
Doses for these drugs are given in Appendix 4.
Note that LPV/r , TDF/3TC and TDF/FTC are currently
available as FDC formulations which simplify dosing and ad -
ministration.
Monitoring Patients on ARV Therapy
In Tanzania, CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is the gold standard meth -
od used to determine the time for initiation and change of therapy.
EachpatientshouldhavehadabaselineCD4+T-lymphocytecount
155
(and viral load where possible) done before initiating treatment,
and CD4+ T-lymphocyte count repeated at least every 6 months.
In most cases treatment will be associated with weight gain and
reduced morbidity from opportunistic infections and improve -
ment in the quality of life. Appearance or persisting opportunistic
infections, or lack of weight gain, may indicate treatment failure
hence the need to consider changing regimens.
Treatment may be considered successful if the viral load decreases
by 1 to 2 logs (10 to 100 folds) from the baseline level. However, in
mostcases,CD4countwillbeusedinsteadofviralloadandsoarise
in CD4+ T-lymphocyte count will indicate treatment success.
On the other hand, treatment failure is indicated with a 10 fold VL
increase or a 50% fall in CD4 count within 6 months.
Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring of Patients
on First Line Drug Regimen
i) Scheduled visits
Patients will attend the clinic monthly to collect medication
and be seen by a professional nurse, Clinical Officer or Assistant
Medical Officer to monitor drug tolerance, adverse events and
adherence. Ideally, the clinic nurse, clinician, pharmacist or
therapeutic counsellor should count drugs at each scheduled
visit. All patients should be seen by a clinician at 2 weeks after
initiation of ART to check for adverse events, perform more
blood tests (ALT or FBC) and to escalate the NVP dose. Patients
should be seen by a clinician at 4, 8 and 12 weeks and 3-monthly
thereafter if well. If not well, patients will need to be seen more
frequently as determined by the treating clinician or nurse. Safety
bloods are to be taken as per schedule. CD4 count will be done
6-monthly while patients are on the first line regimen.

ii) Unscheduled visits
Beyond the scheduled visits, it is also important for the patients
to present themselves to the CTC for management should they
develop any unexpected symptoms and complications. Clinical
judgement will be used to assess whether additional clinical or
laboratory interventions are required.
Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome
(IRIS)
For many opportunistic infections including TB, there can be
a transient worsening of the symptoms of infection at between
2-3 weeks, and sometimes up to 8 weeks after commencement of
ART. This is referred to as the immune reconstitution inflam -
matory syndrome. The risk is high in those with advanced HIV
disease whose CD4 count is <50 cells/mm3.
For patients with TB, this syndrome has been reported to oc -
cur in as many as 30% of patients in the developing world. The
syndrome is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, worsening
pulmonary lesions and expanding central nervous system (CNS)
lesions. These reactions are typically self limiting although they
may require the use of a brief course of corticosteroids to reduce
inflammation for CNS or severe respiratory symptoms.
Initiation of ART can also unmask previously undiagnosed infec -
tions such as hepatitis B or C viral infections as it improves the
inflammatory response while repairing the immune system.
In general, ART should not be interrupted for immune reconsti -
tution syndromes. However, where there is doubt, the opinion
of a senior HIV physician should be sought. The criteria for
making a diagnosis of IRIS are delineated in Table 8.6.
159
Table 8.6: Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome
Diagnosis of infectious IRIS would require:
Both major (A plus B) criteria or Criterion A plus 2 minor criteria
Major criteria
A.A typical presentation of "opportunistic infections or tumours" in patients
responding to antiretroviral therapy (ART) includes:
· Localised disease such as lymph nodes, liver, spleen
· Exaggerated inflammatory reaction, e.g. severe fever, with exclusion of other
causes painful lesions
· Atypical inflammatory response in affected tissues, such as granulomas,
suppuration, necrosis, perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltrate
· Progression of organ dysfunction or enlargement of pre-existing lesions
after definite, clinical improvement with pathogen specific therapy prior to
commencement of ART and exclusion of treatment toxicity and new diagnoses
· Development of enlargement or cerebral space occupying lesions after treatment
for cerebral
· Cryptococcus or toxoplasmosis
· Progressive pneumonitis or the development of organising pneumonia after
treatment for pulmonary
· TB or PCP
· New onset or worsening of uveitis/vitritis after resolution of CMV retinitis
· Fever and cytopenia after treatment for disseminated Mycobacterium avium
complex (MAC) disease
· Enlargement of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions and subsequent resolution or partial
regression without
· Commencement of radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy or intralesional therapy
B.Decrease in plasma HIV-RNA level by > 1 log 10 copies/ml
Minor criteria
· Increased blood CD4+ cell count after HAART
· Increase in immune response specific to the relevant pathogen, such as delayed
type hypersensitivity to mycobacterial antigens
· Spontaneous resolution of disease without specific antimicrobial therapy or tumour
chemotherapy with continuation of anti-retroviral therapy
160 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
Laboratory Monitoring of Patients on Second
Line Drugs
When Changing Treatment the Following Should be
Observed:
· Never change a single drug in the combination if the reason
for changing is treatment failure. Change at least two drugs,
preferably all three drugs.
· If changing due to toxicity, change only the drug suspected
to be causing the problem.
· Never change to monotherapy (i.e. single drug)
· When selecting drugs, choose drugs that have not been used
before, drugs that do not have cross-resistance that have no
overlapping toxicities or drug-drug interactions.
Scheduled Visits
Patients started on a second line regimens need to come to the
clinic every month for the first 3 months to see the doctor and
thereafter every 6 months or as required. Drugs need to be
collected every month.

Treatment Failure with Second Line Regimens
Patients on second-line therapy who begin to fail on the basis of
clinical, immunological, or virological parameters should receive
increased adherence support (refer to chapter 12).
If they continue to fail virologically, despite demonstrated
increased adherence, their ART regimen should be continued
until they cease to derive clinical benefit from the treatment.
Where adherence is consistently <80%, ongoing education and
counselling should be provided.
If the patient experiences an AIDS defining (WHO stage 4)
illness while on second-line therapy, expert opinion should be
sought regarding stopping antiretroviral therapy and instituting
palliative care.
162 Chapter 8: Antiretroviral Therapy in Adults and Adolescents
In Case of Loss to Follow Up
Aggressive follow up is needed by clinic team members in col -
laboration with home based care providers to follow up patients
who do not turn up for their scheduled visits. It is important
to institute and maintain system triggers for this throughout
follow-up. A good referral mechanism should therefore be
established between the clinic and other levels of health care
delivery, including home based care teams.
Contraindications (relative) for initiation of ART
Antiretroviral drugs should be avoided or delayed in the fol -
lowing conditions:
· If compliance is not assured
· If the patient refuses to give consent
· If in the first trimester of pregnancy
· If liver or renal failure occurs
Discontinuation of ART
ART should only be discontinued on advice from specialists.
The only exceptions are cases where:
· The patient is dying and can no longer comply
· There is repeated failure to comply with treatment
· Severe toxicity occurs
163
What Happens to Adherence Over Time?
Adherence declines over time, which is an important phenom -
enon of treatment fatigue. That is why the real challenge to
treatment success is not initial adherence, rather long term
adherence. In this regard, the regimen to be chosen should be
one that patients can adhere to for life.

Antiretroviral regimens for HIV infected children
All antiretroviral drugs approved for treatment of HIV infection
may be used for children. For young children requiring syrup
or liquid formulations, however, there may be limitations in
ART drugs that are available in these formulations. Moreover,
pharmacokinetics parameters in children vary with age and
therefore are more complicated than in adults.
Some ARVs available for adults are also available for children with
specific child formulations. However, formulations appropriate for
usebyyoungchildrenwhocannotswallowwholetabletsorcapsules
areonlystartedtobecomeavailablewidelyavailable. Manydrugsdo
notasyethavefixeddosecombinations(FDC)indosesappropriate
for pediatric use and some fixed dose combinations do not have all
drug components evenly distributed in the tablets (e.g., fixed dose
AZT/3TC).Therefore,theuseoftabletsthatrequirecuttinginorder
to use a portion of the drug, particularly unscored tablets, can result
in under dosing or overdosing of the drug, which in turn can lead to
an increased risk of resistance or toxicity. The national programme
shall therefore strive to provide the widest range possible of dosing
optionsforchildrentomitigaterisksofunder-andover-dosing.Few
paediatricFDCsarenowavailable,seeannex6andmoreareexpected
soon to be registered in Tanzania.
Dosing in children is usually based on either body surface area or
weight. Drug doses must be adjusted as the child grows--otherwise
there is a risk of under dosage, resistance to drugs and suboptimal
response. Standardization is also important so that non-expert
personnel can safely dispense correct doses. It is therefore advanta -
168 Chapter 9: ARV Therapy in Infants and Children
geous to provide health care workers with a table of drug doses that
can be administered according to weight bands.
Goals of Antiretroviral Therapy in Children
The goals of antiretroviral therapy for children are to
· Prolong the survival of HIV-infected children
· Promote optimal growth and development
· Preserve, enhance, or reconstitute the immune system and
therefore reduce opportunistic infections
· Suppress HIV replication and therefore prevent disease
progression
· Reduce the morbidity of children and improve their quality
of life
Also, while on therapy, the child's CD4 count and/or CD4 percent -

(<50 copies/L) viral loads should be achieved and sustained.

Children (Eligibility for ART)
(See Annex 2, WHO Paediatric Clinical Staging of HIV/
AIDS)
Initiation of ART for Children under 18 Months
For HIV-sero-positive infants aged <18 months, initiation of
ARV therapy is recommended in the following cases:
· ART is recommended for all HIV-infected infants below 12
months of age with virologically-proven infection (using HIV
DNA PCR, HIV RNA assay, or immune-complex dissociated
p24 antigen) irrespective of WHO Paediatric Staging and
169
irrespective of CD4 percentage.
· HIV confirmed infected children between 12 and 18 months in
WHO Paediatric disease Stage 1 or 2 with CD4 <750 or <20%
(see table 9.1).
· HIVexposedchildrenaged<18monthswithneithervirological

Initiation of ART for Children over 18 months
For children 18 months of age or older, a positive antibody test
is an indication of HIV infection since any acquired antibodies
from the mother would have degenerated. Initiation of ART is
therefore recommended for children in WHO Paediatric Stage 3
or 4 HIV disease irrespective of CD4 %; or Stage 1 or 2 with:
· CD4 <20% (<750 cells/mm3) for children between 19­35
months of age
· CD4 <20% (350 cells/mm3) for children between 36­59
months of age
· CD4 <15% (200 cells/mm3) for children 5 years old
All children in stage 3 and 4 could be started on ARV therapy
even if a CD4 percent is not available, but an attempt should be
made to do a CD4 percent as soon as possible for monitoring
purposes. In the interim, the child should be monitored clini -
cally every 6 months for CD4 % and clinical status with height,
weight and developmental stages. When in doubt, the attending
clinician should consult or refer the child.
171
Figure 9.2: Clinical eligibility criteria for ART in
children over 18 months
Breastfeeding and ART
The penetration of ARVs into human breast milk in lactating
women has not been quantified for most ARVs. Although some
ARVs, such as Nevirapine, are known to be present in breast milk,
the concentration and quantity of drug that would be ingested
by the infant would be less than needed to achieve therapeutic
levels. Thus, if a breastfeeding infant is ill and requires ARV
treatment, ARVs at standard pediatric doses should be initiated
172 Chapter 9: ARV Therapy in Infants and Children
regardless of whether the mother is receiving ARV therapy or not.
As a matter of fact infected breastfeeding infants whose mothers
are receiving ARV therapy may end up with sub-therapeutic
levels of some ARVs and this could lead to development of drug
resistance in the infant's virus.
Recommended First-Line ARV Regimens in
Infants and Children
The preferred first line treatment options for children are:
· Zidovudine (AZT)+Lamivudine (3TC)+Nevirapine (NVP)
for children under 3 years old
· Zidovudine (AZT)+Lamivudine (3TC)+Efavirenz (EFV)
or Nevirapine (NVP) - for children 3 years old or more
· Abacavir (ABC)+Lamivudine (3TC)+Efavirenz (EFV) for
children 3 years or more or Nevirapine (NVP) for children
under 3 years
· Stavudine (d4T) + Lamuvidine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)
available also as FDC for children (annex 6)
Stavudine (d4T) is an alternate for AZT in cases of anaemia (i.e.
haemoglobin of <7.5g/dl) available as FDC tablets even for very
young children. However, it should be noted that single d4T in
liquid formulation needs refrigeration. Potential side effects such
as peripheral neuropathy are difficult to recognise in children.
If a mother has received ARVs during pregnancy, to reduce mother
to child HIV transmission (MTCT), there is a possibility that
she may transmit a resistant virus to her baby if the baby becomes
infected. This is particularly the case if NVP or 3TC have been
used, either alone or as a component of a two-drug regimen for
prophylaxis of MTCT. Children who require ARV therapy and
who have previously received either single-dose NVP or 3TC
173
as MTCT prophylaxis should be given a second line PI based
regimen. If second line is unavailable these ART eligible children
should be given the first line regimen available. For dosing of
ARV regimens see Annex 5, Peadiatric Antiretroviral Dosing.
Clinical Assessment of Infants and Children
Receiving ARV Therapy
Important clinical signs of response to ARV therapy in children
include improvement in growth in children who are failing to
grow; improvement in neurological symptoms and development
in children who are demonstrating delay in developmental
milestones or encephalopathy; and/or decreased frequency of
infections (bacterial infections, oral thrush, and/or other op -
portunistic infections).
Laboratory assessments in children on ARV therapy are the same
as recommended in adults. In addition to the clinical assessments
recommended in adults, clinical monitoring of ARV treatment
in children should include:
· Nutrition and nutritional status
· Weight and height growth, and head circumference for
children under 3 years old
· Developmental milestones
· Neurologic symptoms
· Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis daily routine
Reasons for Changing ARV Therapy in Infants
and Children
The principles on which to base changes in therapy and the
management of drug toxicity in children are similar to those
applied to adults. When toxicity is related to an identifiable
drug in the regimen, the offending drug can be replaced with
174 Chapter 9: ARV Therapy in Infants and Children
another drug that does not have the same side effects.
Clinical Criteria for Treatment Failure
Clinical conditions indicating that a change to second-line
therapy is warranted include:
· Lack of growth response or decline in growth over a 6-months
period, after excluding other causes, such as TB
· Not meeting neurodevelopmental milestones
· Development of HIV encephalopathy in a child with no
previous manifestations
· Recurrence of infections, such as oral candidiasis, that are
refractory to treatment
· Advancement from one clinical stage to another or new
evidence of stage 3 disease
Note: Short intercurrent episodes of pneumonia, LRTI and
gastroenteritis should not be regarded as clinical failure. TB
can present as a progression to stage 3 disease, and must first
be excluded. Before an ARV regimen is thought to be failing
based on clinical criteria, the child should have had a reasonable
trial on the ARV therapy (e.g. have received the regimen for at
least 6 months).
Immunological Criteria for Treatment Failure
Immunological conditions indicating that a change to second-
line therapy is warranted include:
· Persistent decline in CD4 percent over 2 months in the
absence of TB
· Rapid and substantial decrease in absolute CD4 count (i.e.
 30% decline in <6 months)
· Return of CD4 percent to or below pre-therapy baseline
175
Note:
· CD4 percent should not be measured during an intercurrent
infection; rather, it should be determined 1 month (or more)
post-resolution.
· If there is a modest decline in CD4 percent (< 5%) and
if there is no failure to thrive, do not change medication,
instead maintain close monitoring.
· Despite a good clinical and immunological response, viral
resistance will occur in the absence of complete viral sup -
pression. Many experts will delay changing therapy unless
there are signs of clinical or immunological progression.
Virological Criteria for Treatment Failure
Virological conditions indicating that a change to second-line
therapy is warranted include persistently elevated viral load in
the absence of poor adherence to medication as shown by:
· Progressive increase in viral load after the beginning of treat -
ment (increase in HIV RNA copy number after substantial
response i.e. > 3 fold for >2yrs age, >5 fold for < 2 yrs age)
· Less than 1.0 log decrease from baseline after 24 weeks of
ART
· Repeated viral load detection in children with earlier unde -
tectable levels
The WHO does not currently recommend the use of routine
viral load monitoring to decide on treatment failure. Viral load
assessment can only add useful information where CD4 and
clinical criteria for recognizing treatment failure are conflicting.
In adults, a viral load greater than 10,000 copies is proposed to
reflect viral replication suggestive of treatment failure, upper
limits for children are not yet defined and validation is urgently
176 Chapter 9: ARV Therapy in Infants and Children
required. However, levels of HIV-RNA greater than 100,000
copies in children are associated with greater risk of mortality
and indicate a need to switch therapy.
While total lymphocyte count (TLC) is useful in the absence of
CD4 measurement to guide when to initiate therapy, it should
not be used for the evaluation of response to ARV therapy because
a change in TLC is a poor predictor of treatment success.
Recommended Second-Line ARV Therapy for
Infants and Children
Second-line therapy for children in the event of first-line regimen
failure would include a change in nucleoside backbone, based
on the same principles as for adults.
The recommended second line regimen for infants and children
who have failed their first line is therefore: Didanosine (ddI)
+ Abacavir (ABC) + Ritonavir boosted Lopinavir (LPV/r) or
+ Nelfinavir (NVF). However given the bitter taste of LPV/r,
children sometimes refuse it based on taste. New tablet formula -
tion LPV/r can be used for children > 10 kg.

Chapter 10: TB and HIV Co-Infection
Introduction
TB and HIV are overlapping epidemics. Both have been declared
global emergencies demanding global attention. HIV is the
strongest risk factor for the development of TB. It increases
the progression from TB infection to active disease. While the
lifetime risk of developing TB in an individual who is HIV
negative is 5-10%, for those who are HIV positive, the risk is
30-50%. HIV also increases the risk of TB reactivation. On the
other hand, TB increases the risk of progression from HIV to
AIDS and is the most common opportunistic infection and the
major cause of death among AIDS patients.
HIVisfuellingtheTBepidemicinmanycountriesespeciallyinSub-
Saharan Africa. In Tanzania, TB cases have increased six-fold from
11,843 in 1983 to 62,100 in 2006, mainly due to HIV/AIDS. About
50%ofTBpatientsinTanzaniaareco-infectedwithHIV,accounting
for 60-70% of the increase in the number of TB patients.
TB Management in HIV and AIDS Patients
Pattern of HIV-related TB
HIV not only increases the number of TB cases, but also alters
the clinical course of TB disease. As HIV infection progresses,
CD4+ T-Lymphocytes that play an important role in the body's
defence against tubercle bacilli decline in number and function.
Thus, the immune system becomes less able to prevent the growth
and local spread of M. tuberculosis. The more common types are
disseminated and extra-pulmonary TB.
Pulmonary TB
Even in HIV-infected patients, pulmonary TB (PTB) is still
182 Chapter 10: TB and HIV Co-Infection
the most common presenting feature. In Tanzania, about 43%
of new TB patients present with smear positive pulmonary
tuberculosis (PTB+) and 35% with smear negative pulmonary
tuberculosis (PTB-).
The WHO defines smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis in high
HIVprevalentsettingsasapatientwithonesputumsmearexamina -
tionpositiveforacid-fastbacilli(AFB)andlaboratoryconfirmation
of HIV infection.
Smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis is defined as the pres -
ence of at least two sputum specimens negative for AFB, ra -
diographical abnormalities consistent with active tuberculosis
and laboratory confirmation of HIV infection. Pulmonary TB
is also indicated when a clinician decides to treat with a full
course of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy or when a patient
has AFB smear-negative sputum which is culture-positive for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Extra-pulmonary Tuberculosis (EPTB)
About 22% of new TB patients in Tanzania present as EPTB.
The most common forms of extra pulmonary TB are pleural
effusion, lymphadenopathy, pericardial disease, milliary disease,
meningitis, spinal TB (Pott's disease) and disseminated TB. EPTB
is defined as tuberculosis in organs other than the lungs proven
by one specimen from an extra-pulmonary site culture-positive
for Mycobacterium tuberculosis or smear-positive for AFB; or as
histological evidence consistent with active extra-pulmonary
tuberculosis and laboratory confirmation of HIV infection
or strong clinical evidence of HIV infection and a decision
by a clinician to treat with a full course of anti-tuberculosis
chemotherapy.

Combined Treatment of TB and HIV/AIDS
In patients with both tuberculosis and HIV, the priority is to
treat tuberculosis. However, patients with HIV- related TB can
be given anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and anti-TB treatment
at the same time, but this has to be managed carefully.
Careful judgment of when to start ART is necessary. For example
in an HIV-positive TB patient on anti-TB treatment who has a
high risk of dying (low CD4 and/or poor clinical condition) the
start of ART alongside anti-TB treatment can be life saving. On
the other hand, in an HIV positive TB patient with a CD4 count
of 350 or more and/or in relatively good clinical condition, who
does not appear to have a high risk of dying, it is safer to postpone
ART until the anti-TB treatment has been successfully completed.
This decreases the risk of tuberculosis-associated immune recon -
stitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and avoids the risk of
drug interaction between rifampicin with NNRTIs and Protease
Inhibitors (PIs). If ART is combined with rifampicin containing
anti-TBtreatment,thecombinationofEfavirenz+2NRTIsshould
be used (contraindicated in pregnancy).
184 Chapter 10: TB and HIV Co-Infection
Management of Patients
Co-infected with HIV and TB
The following two scenarios summarise the management of
patients co-infected with HIV and TB:
A patient develops tuberculosis while on antiretroviral therapy
Antiretroviral therapy should be continued throughout TB
treatment, with changes as follows:
· First line drugs: Substitute Nevirapine for Efavirenz. If this
is not possible (e.g. intolerant of Efavirenz or significant risk
of falling pregnant) Nevirapine may be substituted with
Abacavir or Saquinavir/Ritonavir.
· Second line drugs: Lopinavir/Ritonavir should be changed
to Saquinavir/Ritonavir (dose: 400/400 mg every 12 hours
­ 3 extra caps of Ritonavir). This should be continued until
2 weeks after completion of TB treatment when the extra
Ritonavir can be stopped.
A patient presents with TB before commencing ART
· If the patient has a CD4+ count of more than 350 cells/mm3,
antiretroviral therapy is not needed. However, the need for
antiretroviral treatment should be reassessed on completion
of TB treatment.
· If the patient has a history of WHO Stage 4 illness and/or
a CD4+ count of 200 ­ 350 cells/mm3, complete 2 months
of TB therapy before commencing ART.
· If the patient has a CD4+ count of <200 cells/mm3 or
other serious HIV-related illness, make sure that the patient
is tolerating TB treatment (after about 2 weeks) before
initiating ART. Patients in this group should be started on
185
first-line therapy consisting of AZT/3TC/EFV, for adults
and children of age > 3 years. If the patient is <3 years refer
to specialist or paediatrician in HIV clinic.
Table 10.2: Special considerations of ART in TB
and HIV co-infected patients
CD4 > 350 Treat TB first, re-asses for ART after completion of
TB treatment
CD4 200 ­ 350 Treat TB first for two month before starting ART
CD4 < 200 or CD4 < 15% or
WHO HIV stage 4
Begin ART as early as 2 weeks after TB treatment
initiation
Tuberculosis Associated Immune
Reconstitution Syndrome
HIV positive patients may experience an occurrence of features
of active TB or a temporary exacerbation of signs and symptoms
of TB with or without an aggravated radiographic manifesta -
tion after the initiation of ART. This paradoxical reaction in
HIV infected TB patients is a result of immune reconstitution.
Signs and symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, central
nervous system lesions and worsening of the chest X-ray ap -
pearance. This syndrome is known as the Immune Inflammatory
Reconstitution Syndrome (IRIS). In such cases, it is crucial that
TB treatment failure is excluded before diagnosing IRIS. The
management includes continuation of both ART and anti-TB
therapies, and if severe, Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg for 1-2 weeks can
be given (thereafter gradually decreasing dosage).
Cotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy (CPT) in HIV
Positive TB Patients
CPT has proven to be beneficial to patients infected with HIV,
includingHIVpositiveTBpatients,bypreventingseveralsecondary
186 Chapter 10: TB and HIV Co-Infection
bacterial,fungalandparasiticOIs. Thissignificantlyreducesmorbid -
ity and hospital admission for OIs. The 6-8 months TB treatment
provides a unique opportunity to provide CPT concurrently since
adherence to treatment is a major concern for both TB treatment
and CPT. For instructions on dosing of CPT for adults, see chapter
6, Proplylactic treatment using co-trimoxazole, pp. 98-100.
HIV-related TB in Children
The natural history of TB in a child infected with HIV is similar to
that of an adult as it depends on the stage of HIV disease. During
early stages of HIV infection when immunity is good, the signs of
TB are similar to those in a child without HIV infection. As HIV
infection progresses and immunity declines, dissemination of TB
becomes more common and tuberculosis meningitis, miliary TB,
and widespread tuberculosis lymphadenopathy occur.
The Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Children
The diagnosis of TB in children can be very difficult due to the
wide range of symptoms. Sputum cannot often be obtained
from children and is often negative even on culture. Symptoms
in children are not typical. The diagnosis should therefore be
based on clinical findings (especially failure to thrive or weight
loss), family history of contact with a smear positive case, X-ray
examination, culture (if available), and non-response to broad
spectrum antibiotic treatment. Older children who are able to
cough up sputum should go through the same assessment as adults
using smear microscopy as the "gold standard".
Treatment of TB in children
In principle, TB treatment in children does not differ from that in
adults.NearlyallpulmonaryTBinchildrenissputumsmearnegative

meningitis,miliaryTBorTBofthespineshouldbedefinedascategory
I. Treatment can be provided with adult formulation following the
dose-body weight relationship presented in tables 4 and 5.
For children with severe forms of TB, Ethambutol is recom -
mended at a dose of 15 mg/kg (2RHZE/4RH). The feared
side effect of retro-bulbar neuritis is rarely seen in children
taking higher dosages exceeding 20 mg/kg for a long period of
time. Nevertheless, if there is any doubt, an alternative regimen
(2RHZ/4RH) for young children can be applied. For CPT dosing
in children, see Annex 5, Peadiatric Antiretroviral Dosing.
BCG Vaccination
BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) is a live attenuated vaccine derived
from M. bovis. In Tanzania, the BCG vaccination is included in
the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI). The vaccine is
given intra-dermally in the upper part of the right arm at a dose
of 0.05 ml to all neonates shortly after birth. The dose increases
to 0.1 ml if the vaccine is given to children older than one year.

The WHO recommends that in countries with a high prevalence
of tuberculosis like Tanzania, BCG should be given to all neonates
immediately after birth, regardless of HIV status. The possible
benefits of BCG outweigh the possible disadvantages. However,
BCG should not be given to children who present with clear signs
and symptoms of HIV-disease or AIDS.
188 Chapter 10: TB and HIV Co-Infection
Collaborative TB/HIV Interventions
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is implementing
collaborative TB/HIV activities with the goal of decreasing the
burden of TB and HIV in populations affected by both diseases.
The measures being implemented include:
· Establishing mechanisms for collaboration between TB
and HIV/AIDS programmes, e.g. by setting up effective
coordinating bodies for TB/HIV activities at all levels.
· Instituting measures to decrease the burden of TB in people
living with HIV/AIDS.
· Establishing intensified TB case finding by screening PLHAs
for TB.
TB screening among people living with HIV/AIDS is an es -
sential strategy for decreasing the burden of tuberculosis and
preventing its spread in people with HIV. It is also a strategy
for intensified TB case finding.
All patients with HIV infection should undergo routine TB
screening. This can be done with the administration of a simple
questionnaire as shown on the following page that asks about
TB symptoms.
· If a patient screens negative for TB symptoms (i.e. answers
no to all symptoms) the screening can be repeated in a
subsequent visit.
· If he or she answers positively to any of the questions, the
patient may have TB (TB suspect). Further patient evalua -
tion should follow NTLP guidelines.
189

4 Has the individual noticed weight loss (new patients) or a 3 kgs
weight loss in a month (in a subsequent visit)?
5 Has the individual had excessive sweating at night  2weeks?
· If YES to one or more questions, follow NTLP TB diagnostic flow chart.
· If NO to all questions: stop TB investigations and repeat screening at the subsequent visit.
Provision of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT)
TB disease develops in only 10% of all the individuals infected with
M. tuberculosis. However, in HIV infected individuals this can be
up to 50%. TB preventive therapy is an intervention that should be
part of the package of care for people living with HIV. IPT is given
to individuals with latent infection of M. tuberculosis in order to
prevent progression to active disease. In these patients, the risk of
developingtuberculosisisreducedbyabout60%andtheirsurvivalis
alsoprolonged.Theprotectiveeffectisexpectedtolastfor18months.
It is however, important to exclude active TB before starting IPT.
IPTisgiven at a dosage of 300 mg dailyfor6 monthsforadults.For
children the dosage is 5mg/kg body weight daily for six months, but
it should be noted that excluding TB in children is difficult making
IPT for children not easily feasible.
IPT should only be offered in the following situations:
· Where quality supportive counselling is available
· After effective screening for active TB  
190 Chapter 10: TB and HIV Co-Infection
· Where there is capacity for follow up and monitoring of
patients to encourage adherence to preventive therapy
· Where there is capacity to manage side effects and exclude
active TB during IPT
Eligibility for TB Preventive Therapy among PLHAs
For patients with no history of TB treatment:
· All HIV positive individuals with no signs or symptoms sug -
gestive of active TB are eligible for TB preventive therapy.
For patients with history of TB treatment:
· Patients who had active tuberculosis in the past 2 years should
not be considered for preventive therapy.
· Patients who were treated for tuberculosis more than 2 years
earlier may be considered because they may have already
been re-infected with TB.
· PatientswhoreceiveTBpreventivetherapyandwhoareeligible
for antiretroviral therapy can complete their TB preventive
therapyevenifARTisstartedasthereisnointeractionbetween
Isoniazid and the current ART regimen used.
TB Infection Control in Health Care and
Congregate Settings
A TB suspect should be considered infectious until a diagnostic
evaluation is completed and this person either has a negative
sputum smears result or has completed at least two weeks of
anti-TB therapy under DOT.
The TB Infection Control
The control plan should include:
· Screening of all clients to identify persons with a cough of two
191
weeks or more as soon as possible after arrival at the facility.
· In outpatient departments, coughing patients should wait
outside or in well-ventilated areas.
· TB suspects need to be examined in a well-ventilated room.
Avoid contact between TB patients and HIV positive patients,
though this can be difficult as the two patient groups have a
large overlap.
· Have patients turn their heads and cover their mouths when
they cough. Provide tissues to persons with symptoms of TB
disease ("TB suspects")
Suggested clinic operating procedure:
Patients who report at CTC to register should be asked about
coughing and if so for more than 2 weeks sent immediately to
laboratory to provide a sputum sample and return to CTC for
registration and care.
This reduces the duration of potential exposure in the facility.
Environmental Control Measures
Environmental control is the second line of defence for pre -
venting the spread of TB in HIV care settings. If the work
practice controls are inadequate, environmental control will
not eliminate the risk of spread of TB. The common control
measures include:
· Open doors and windows to bring in air from the outside.
· Waiting areas and examination rooms designed in a manner
that they have maximum natural ventilation. Fans may also
assist in the process of air distribution.
· Collection of sputum for TB outside (in an open environ -
ment) and away from other people, not in small rooms or
192 Chapter 10: TB and HIV Co-Infection
other enclosed areas.
Protection of Health Care Workers
The primary way to prevent transmission of TB to health workers
and others at the health facility is for TB patients to take their
drugs regularly. By doing so, they will become non-infectious in
a week or two. Proper ventilation of the place where treatment
is provided is also very important.
In addition:
· All health care workers should be made aware of the increased
risk of developing TB when they are HIV positive.
· Those working in hospital departments where TB patients
are admitted should be advised to have an HIV test. If they
test positive, they should avoid contact with TB suspects
and patients.
· Normal masks do not protect medical staff against inhaling
infected droplets and are therefore not recommended as a
preventive measure for health staff.

Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in
Pregnancy
Introduction
In Sub-Saharan Africa the majority (61%) of people living with
HIV are women. Mother to child transmission is responsible for
over 90% of new infections in infants and young children.
In Tanzania HIV prevalence is higher (7.7%) among women
compared to men (6.3). Also, HIV prevalence is significantly
higher (11%) in urban areas than in rural areas (5%).1
The recent Global Strategy for Accelerating PMTCT Scale-up
is based on the UN recommendation of a comprehensive four-
element strategy to prevent HIV in infants and young children2
which includes:
· Primary prevention of HIV among women of reproductive
age
· Prevention of unintended pregnancies among women living
with HIV
· Prevention of HIV transmission during pregnancy, delivery
and breastfeeding
· Treatment, care and support for women living with HIV,
their children and families.
Primary prevention of HIV among
Women and Their Partners
Since there is no cure for HIV infection, primary prevention of

2012), Prime Minister's Office, October 2008

meeting. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2003
196 Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in Pregnancy
infection is the most effective means of controlling the spread
of HIV and its impact on individuals, families and communi -
ties. Preventing HIV infection in women of childbearing age is
the best way to prevent MTCT. The following should be taken
into consideration:
· Encouraging sexually active women and men to adopt safer
sex including the use of barrier methods (condoms) for
prevention of HIV infection.
· All national healthcare services should emphasize early
diagnosis and treatment of STIs.
· Providing young people with information and services to
keep them free of HIV infection and encouraging them to
abstain from sex until they can make responsible decisions.
· Encouraging sexually active women and men to be faithful
to their regular sexual partners.
· Encouraging and supporting women of childbearing age and
their partners to know their HIV status.
· Prevention measures to include the counselling of HIV-
negative women on safer sexual practices and getting their
partners tested.
· Using similar criteria for sero-negative and sero-positive
women and following practices for universal precautions
for blood transfusions during pregnancy and labour when
indicated. (see chapter 4).
Prevention of Unintended Pregnancies
among Women Infected with HIV
Although family planning is part of a comprehensive public
health strategy to prevent MTCT, it has been neglected in most
programs. Having children or not is every woman's or couple's
right. The use of FP should respect and respond to reproductive
197
rights of a woman and her partner. HIV-infected women should
receive information about preventing unintended pregnancies,
the risks of MTCT of HIV infection and consequences thereof,
thus enabling them to make informed decisions.
All HIV-infected women and their partners (HIV-infected and
uninfected) should be counselled on family planning to enable
them choose appropriate and effective contraceptive methods.
During pregnancy this should start during the antenatal period.
Programs should take advantage of the high attendance of
women at child welfare clinics to counsel and provide them
with effective contraception during the post partum period.
The provision of family planning services during this period
will greatly reduce the number of unintended and unplanned
pregnancies thus reducing MTCT. Care and Treatment Centres
also offer a major opportunity for providing or referring to
family planning services.
Note: All contraceptive methods need to be tailored to a woman's
health and preference. However, dual protection is recom -
mended for HIV-infected women. Condoms along with a second
contraceptive method can prevent both pregnancy and STIs
including HIV.
Prevention of HIV Transmission During
Pregnancy, Delivery and Breastfeeding
Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (MTCT)
The risk of MTCT is estimated at 15­40% in the developing
world. Transmission of HIV from mother to child accounts for
over 90% of all HIV infection in children aged below 15 years.
198 Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in Pregnancy
Figure 11.1: HIV outcomes for infants
born of women infected with HIV
There are multiple risk factors that increase the chance of MTCT
of HIV. These include viral, maternal, obstetric and neonatal
factors.
Viral Factors
· Viral load: High maternal viral load and low CD4 count
occurs in new infection with HIV or advanced AIDS
· Viral strain: Different strains have different rates of trans -
mission and transmission is higher with HIV-1 than HIV-2.
It is also higher with C and E subgroups.
· Viral resistance: Pre-existing resistance to available ARV
drugs used for prophylaxis
199
Factors During Pregnancy
· High maternal viral load and low CD4 count (new infection
or advanced AIDS)
· Placental infections, e.g. malaria
· Febrile illnesses
· Genital tract infections
· Behavioural factors (e.g., cigarette smoking, use of hard
drugs and unprotected sex)
· Micronutrients and vitamin deficiency
· Antepartum Haemorrhage
· Pre-term rupture of foetal membranes
· Chorioamnionitis
Factors During Labour and Delivery
· High maternal viral load and low CD4 count (new infection
or advanced AIDS)
· Prolonged labour for more than 4 hours before delivery3
· Invasive delivery procedures that increase contact with
mother's infected blood or body fluids (e.g., episiotomy, ar -
tificial rupture of membranes, vacuum extraction delivery
· Complicated deliveries (e.g., breech delivery because of the
likelihood of manipulation in breech delivery)
· Chorioamnionitis (from untreated STI or other infections)
· Preterm delivery
· Low birth weight
· Intrapartum haemorrhage
3 Studies have found that there is an increased rate of HIV transmission after a mother's
membranes have been ruptured for more than 4 hours before delivery. The longer the time
gap between membrane rupture and delivery, the higher the risk of HIV transmission.
200 Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in Pregnancy
Breastfeeding Factors
· High maternal viral load and low CD4 count (new infection
or advanced AIDS)
· Duration of breastfeeding
· Mixed feeding (e.g., breastfeeding combined with other
foods or fluids)
· Oral disease in the baby (e.g., thrush or mouth sores)
· Poor maternal nutritional status (e.g., micronutrient and
vitamin deficiencies)
· Breast disease (abscesses, nipple fissures and mastitis)
Integrating PMTCT into Routine Reproductive
and Child Health Services
Antenatal care (ANC) improves the general health and well-being
of pregnant mothers and their unborn children. Determining a
woman's HIV status is the first step in providing appropriate ANC
services. ANC should be provided on a routine basis with proper
information to assist the mother to consent. Counselling on the
test result is essential to improve maternal health and prevent
MTCT of HIV. The second step is to provide cost-effective
pregnancy ARTs at the appropriate times during the pregnancy
and labour periods to HIV positive women who get pregnant.
Adoption of safer practices in the provision of ANC and the
carrying out of labour will also contribute to the prevention of
MTCT. See discussion that follows.
Comprehensive Antenatal Care for HIV-infected
Pregnant Women
ANC for HIV-infected pregnant women includes the same basic
services provided for all pregnant women. However, obstetric
and medical care should be expanded to address the specific
needs of HIV-infected women including
201
· Provision of prophylactic ARV
· ARV treatment for the mother if indicated
· Provision of appropriate obstetric care
· Infant feeding counselling and support
· Promotion  to establish the spouse's (partner) HIV status
Specific actions to be taken:
· Antenatal care for HIV-infected women should take into
account the health of the mother as well as the need to re -
duce the risk of HIV transmission to the infant. Antenatal
examinations should therefore include a focus on HIV-related
symptoms and opportunistic infections including TB and
follow national guidelines for prophylaxis and treatment.
Where prenatal diagnostic investigations are indicated, non-
invasive screening tests should be considered first, to reduce
the risk of MTCT.
· In accordance with national guidelines, routine tests including
anaemia, syphilis, urine analysis and full blood picture (FBP).
If available, do a CD4+ T-cell count before referral to CTC.
· Assess for signs and symptoms of common infections in preg -
nancy, such as urinary tract, respiratory and genital tract infec -
tions. Treat promptly according to national guidelines and
administer tetanus toxoid immunisations when appropriate.
· Provide counselling on adequate and nutritious food. Give
routine iron, folate, and multivitamin supplements according
to national guidelines.
· CPT should be provided for all HIV infected pregnant
women (see criteria chapter 6) throughout pregnancy.
· Asmalariaisamajorcauseofhighmaternalandinfantmorbidity
and mortality, administer sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) as
prophylaxis at 20-24 weeks and again at 28-32 weeks (always
202 Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in Pregnancy
make sure treatment is one month apart). Malaria prevention
with SP is not required for women who are on CPT.
· All HIV infected women require infant-feeding counselling
and support. Promote and support exclusive breastfeeding
for women who do not know their HIV status and consider
replacement feeding for HIV-infected women if it is acceptable,
feasible, affordable, accessible, and safe (AFASS); otherwise
encourage them to practice exclusive breastfeeding for the
first 6 months.
· Counsel about consistent use of condoms during pregnancy,
as well as throughout postpartum and breastfeeding periods
to avoid STIs and HIV re-infection. Discuss family planning
options and future fertility and involve partner when possible.
Whenever acceptable advise dual protection methods.
· Assess pregnant women's family and social support networks
and refer those in need to AIDS support organisations,
faith-based organizations and clubs.
· Provide psychological counselling and social support with
referrals where indicated.
· Emphasize the importance of keeping all ANC appoint -
ments as well as all postpartum and ongoing follow-up care
appointments for both mother and infant/child.
· Discuss and plan delivery options and place of delivery with
the patient and whenever feasible involve the spouse and/
or another key member of the family for possible financial
support for transport etc.
Care During Labour and Delivery
Determining women's HIV status
· When feasible, women with unknown HIV status may
203
receive routine pre-test education and rapid HIV testing so
that ARV prophylaxis can be administered before delivery.
Women who receive HIV testing during labour and delivery
should receive additional HIV post-test counselling during
the postnatal period.
· If testing during labour is not possible, women should receive
HIV counselling and testing and infant feeding counselling
during the immediate postpartum period and before hospital
discharge so that the infant can receive ARV prophylaxis.
Administer ARV prophylaxis during labour and delivery
· Continue ARV treatment or implement ARV prophylaxis
during labour to reduce maternal viral load and provide
protection to the infant.
· Women on ARV treatment should receive all ARV drugs
according to their regular dosing schedule.
· All infants born of HIV-infected women should receive ARV
prophylaxis regardless of whether the mother has received
ARV.
Labour and delivery care
Labour management should follow normal obstetric guidelines.
HCWs should implement the safer obstetric practices to reduce
MTCT, whenever practical. This should be individualised
as much as possible to avoid increasing risk of maternal and
neonatal mortality.
HIV-infected women in labour should be treated with respect and
dignity and their confidentiality must be maintained. Observance
of infection control is critical for health workers and mothers.
204 Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in Pregnancy
Safer obstetrical practices to reduce MTCT include:
Use Standard Precautions (good infection prevention
practices) for all patient care:
· Use protective gear, safely use and dispose of sharps,
sterilise equipment and safely dispose of contaminated
materials.
· Perform vaginal examinations according to obstetric
protocol and avoid unnecessary vaginal examinations.
Avoid unnecessary premature rupture of membranes:
· Use a partogram to measure the progress of labour and
indicate medications used during labour including ARV
prophylaxis.
· Rupture membranes only when there is an obstetric
indication (e.g., when there is an element of prolonged
labour and when augmentation with oxytocin is
required)
Avoid unnecessary trauma during delivery:
· Avoid routine episiotomy.
· Minimise the use of instrumental vaginal delivery (Use
vacuum extraction with caution when one wants to
prevent prolonged second stage).
Minimise the risk of postpartum haemorrhage:
· Carefully manage all stages of labour to prevent
infection and avoid prolonged labour.
· Actively manage the third stage of labour, by using
oxytocic drugs and controlled cord traction.
· Perform uterine massage.
205
· Repair genital track lacerations promptly.
· Carefully remove all products of conception.
Considerations regarding mode of delivery:
· When caesarean section is performed before the onset
of labour or membrane rupture, MTCT will be further
reduced. However post partum infection risks are
higher among seropositive women after caesarean
section. In Tanzania, caesarean section is only indicated
for life saving obstetric reasons for pregnant women
independent of serostatus
Home Birth Attendants (HBA)
To prevent infection during labour and delivery, HBAs should
receive information on
· Mechanisms by which HIV is transmitted from mother to
child
· Their own risk of infection and how to protect themselves
· Basic skills to deliver PMTCT interventions, including safer
delivery practices
· Standard precautions to prevent infections
· Use of home prepacked Nevirapine  where available
Care after a Spontaneous Abortion (Miscarriage)
HCWs should do the following for women who have a sponta -
neous abortion:
· Provide HIV counselling and testing
· Assess for signs and symptoms of HIV infection/AIDS
· Consider using antibiotics after uterine evacuation
· Counsel on family-planning
206 Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in Pregnancy
Management of Infants During the Early
Postpartum Period
Postpartum care
The immediate care of a newly born HIV-exposed infant should
follow standard practice. Regardless of the mother's HIV status, all
infants should be kept warm after birth and handled with gloved
hands until maternal blood and secretions have been washed off.
Safer delivery practices for infants
The following are other practices that can ensure the safety
of infants born of HIV-infected women and help to minimize
trauma to the infant and reduce the infant's exposure to
infected blood and maternal secretions:
· Clamping the cord immediately after birth, and avoiding
squeezing the umbilical cord towards the infant.
Covering the cord with a gloved hand or gauze before
cutting it to avoid splashing of blood from the cord.
· Using suction method only when the baby shows signs of
distress or aspiration, and preferably mechanical suction at
less than 100 mm Hg pressure or bulb suction.
· Wiping/drying the infant with a towel.
· The baby should be bathed as soon as possible to
remove any blood and maternal secretions
· Determining the mother's feeding choice. If replacement
feeding is used, place the infant on mother's body for
skin-to-skin contact and provide help with the first
feeding. If breastfeeding is the preferred choice, place
the infant on mother's breast.
207
· Administering BCG vaccine according to national
guidelines.
· For non-breastfed infants, administering vitamin A
50,000 IUs within 6 months while breastfed infants
receive Vitamin A starting at 9 months according to
national guidelines.
Follow-up Care for HIV-infected Mothers
The postpartum period should provide continuing treatment,
care, and support. It is also the final opportunity to connect
mothers and their children with follow-up care, treatment and
support. HCWs at postpartem clinics should facilitate referrals
and linkages to HIV treatment, care and support programmes
to ensure that the mother receives ongoing care.
The patient's first postpartum appointment should be within one
week (7 days) after delivery. Additional appointments should
take place at 28 days and 42 days after birth.
HIV-infected mothers should be referred to a CTC for ongo -
ing HIV treatment, care and support services (if they have not
already been referred and assessed at the CTC).
Required postpartum services include the following:
· Physical assessment
· Infant-feeding support
· Sexual and reproductive health care, including family planning
· Screening for cervical and breast cancer
· HIV treatment care and support
· Prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections, includ -
ing tuberculosis malaria
208 Chapter 11: HIV and AIDS in Pregnancy
· Immunisations
· Nutritional counselling and support
· Social and psychosocial support and referral for home-based
care as needed
Use of Antiretroviral (ARV) Drugs During
Pregnancy
Use of antiretroviral drugs has been shown to reduce the risk of
HIV transmission from mother to child.
Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission
The choice of ARV medications to be used to prevent MTCT is
based on the resources and expertise available to administer the
regimen at the facility level and according to the national policy/
programme. PMTCT programmes should deliver combination
regimens for PMTCT that include AZT, NVP and 3TC to sites
that have the capacity to offer and monitor ARV therapy. PMTCT
programmes at sites that do not have the capacity to delivery ARV
therapy or where ARV medications are not available, should con -
tinue to provide the minimum regimen of a single dose of NVP to
mother and child.

ARV prophylaxis for infants
The sooner the infant dose is given, the greater the protective
effect. It is therefore advisable to administer ARV prophylaxis
regimens to the infant immediately after birth.
· If a mother has not received any prophylaxis during pregnancy,
labour or delivery, a single dose NVP and AZT should be
211
given to the infant as soon it can tolerate oral feedings.
AZT administered after 48 hours and NVP after 72 hours
is unlikely to have any benefit.
· If the minimum PMTCT regimen is used (single dose NVP
for mother and infant) the infant dose can be given up to
72 hours after birth.
· If a mother delivers within 2 hours of receiving a single dose
of NVP, the infant dose should be given immediately.
ARV Therapy During Pregnancy
· Women who become pregnant while receiving ARV therapy
should continue treatment but may need to change the medi -
cations in the ARV regimen to avoid potential birth defects.
For example, Efavirenz (EFV) can cause birth defects and
therefore it should not be used for pregnant women during
the first trimester.
· Women who are diagnosed with HIV during pregnancy and
who are eligible for ARV therapy should start ARV therapy
as soon as possible according to the guidelines. The recom -
mended first-line regimen for HIV-infected pregnant women
is Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Nevirapine
(NVP). Women on ARV treatment should not receive a
single-dose of NVP during labour.
· Pregnant women receiving ARV therapy should receive
ongoing care and monitoring through the CTC. When
co-infected with TB, additional drug therapy and clinical
management are required to minimize side effects that may
occur with co-administration of HIV and TB therapy.

Chapter 12: Counselling related
to HIV testing and Treatment
Adherence
Introduction
This chapter looks at counselling as it relates to two modes of
counselling for HIV testing: Provider Initiated Testing and
Counselling (PITC) and the standard Voluntary Counselling
and Testing (VCT) that is client-initiated. It also looks at
counselling as it relates to ART adherence.
Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling
PITC is currently being used to reinforce expansion of access to
HIV testing and increase the number of persons accessing and
utilizing HIV/AIDS-related interventions including PMTCT,
treatment of OIs, psychosocial support, and ART. In settings
where HIV testing is conducted and results are shared between a
client and a service provider, the provision of HIV information
will normally precede blood testing as the core of HIV testing
and counselling services. However, under this new approach,
clients can be tested for HIV without having to sign an informed
consent form. For minors or comatose clients, informed consent
should be obtained from a guardian or close relative.
In PITC the main aim is to provide a clinical decision for the
benefit of the client with less focus on prevention counselling
and more on ensuring that the HIV positive client receives
comprehensive HIV care. Nevertheless, provider-initiated HIV
testing and counselling must respect human rights and good
clinical practices which include (i) the need for a client's verbal
consent to undergo testing; (ii) confidentiality of both the
216 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
process and the test results; (iii) provision of post test counsel -
ling and support to HIV positive clients to help them cope with
their status; and (iv) offering testing only if medical services and
a link to clinical HIV care are available.
Voluntary Counselling and Testing (client-initiated)
VCT on the other hand uses the client-centred approach to HIV
counselling that places less emphasis on education, persuasion
and test results and more on personalised risk assessment. The
approach encourages the development of a personalised risk
reduction plan for each client, which takes into account (i) the
client's emotional reactions, (ii) their own situation, (iii) their
social/cultural context (iv) the targeted risk behaviour and (v) the
client's readiness to change the targeted behaviour. The content of
the counselling sessions and the amount of counselling that each
client receives is determined by the client's level of knowledge
and their specific personal concerns about HIV and/or AIDS.
Rather than providing standardised information about HIV
and AIDS, the counsellor solicits information about what the
client already knows, or has heard, and corrects misperceptions
by providing additional information through discussion.
In VCT, the counsellor assists the client to cope with emotional
reactions and the consequences of their HIV risk behaviour.
The counsellor also assists the client to weigh whether taking
the HIV antibody test at that particular time is consistent with
the client's personal risk reduction goals.
ART Adherence Counselling
When clients/clients test positive for HIV they are referred to
a CTC. Due to the special characteristics of HIV/AIDS care
and treatment, access to care and treatment services signifies the
217
start of a life-long relationship between the CTC client and the
CTC facility staff. Emphasis is on a strict need for 95% or greater
adherence to prescribed ARV drugs, for life. There is also more
emphasis on viral suppression rather than on curing AIDS. As such,
attaining the required level of ARV drug adherence is important
because viral suppression cannot be achieved when ARV drugs are
not used as prescribed, and for life. This is because viral replication
results in the rapid development of mutations of the virus which
then becomes resistant to the ARV drug. The consequences of this
include a lack of response to treatment by the client; transmission
of a drug resistant HIV virus to the client's (sexual) contacts and
consequently, the presence of a larger number of people with drug
resistant HIV virus in the community. The resulting program -
matic implication of this is the loss of effectiveness of the first
line regimen that will have wide public health implications for
the entire country. Adherence is therefore a major requirement
for successful care and treatment of HIV/AIDS.
Counselling Skills
Relationship Building Skills
Relationship building skills are essential for building rapport
and "joining in" with clients. Skills involved in rapport build-
ing include common courtesy (greetings and introductions
appropriate to culture and context), emotional presence, and
appropriate vocal tone and speech rate. The relationship building
process requires counselling staff to show empathy by putting
themselves in their clients' shoes in order to better understand
the client's perspective and communicate this understanding to
the client. Empathy is the ability to tune into the client's feelings
and respond in a way that the client knows that he/she has been
heard. Empathy is not the same as sympathy, which is feeling
218 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
sorry for another. The ability to demonstrate empathy is a key
skill in promoting rapport between a counsellor and client such
that the client opens up, even to the extent of disclosing very
personal information.
Empathy is evidenced when one:
· Listens to all the feelings and not selectively
· Responds with understanding without trying to minimize
or change the client's feelings
· Does not try to judge, solve, advise, tell or question.
Information Gathering Skills
In counselling, information-gathering skills are the most important
tool that a counsellor uses to encourage the client to tell their story.
The process of information gathering involves listening to the
client's own words, focusing not only on the factual information
but also on details such as choice and emphasis of words, and/or
word misuse. It also involves gauging the client's mood, feelings
and underlying messages that are being conveyed through verbal
cues (actual words) and non-verbal cues including:
· Body language such as body movements, posture and gestures
· Facial expression such as twisted lips, twinkles and smiles
· Voice tones such as pitch of voice, level and intensity, pauses
and fluency and
· The client's general appearance such as type of dress and
walking mannerism
Non-verbal cues and messages can be interpreted differently in
different cultures so one needs to develop a working knowledge
of the meaning of the different non-verbal cues in the environ -
ment in which one works.
219
Listening on the other hand involves knowing what to listen for,
suspending judgment, recalling expressions, looking for themes,
resisting distractions and reflecting on what is being said. Effective
listening also involves complete focus on the client and not doing
other tasks while listening to him/her, encouraging the client to
speak out and acknowledging their feelings. A counsellor needs to
use paraphrasing to check whether they have understood the client
and refrain from interrupting the client unnecessarily. Listening
also involves asking questions if you do not understand.
Attending skills are a very important aspect of listening skills
and involve:
· Establishing good eye contact
· Having a relaxed body posture
· Ensuring good body language
· Listening to feelings
· Eliciting concerns
To apply attending skills one needs to face the client squarely in the
facebyadoptingaposturethatindicatesinvolvementwiththeclient,
and adopt an open posture such as leaning towards the client with a
slight inclination towards him or her which says "I am interested in
whatyouaresaying."Thecounsellorshouldmaintaingoodeyecontact
but not stare at the client as this may be seen as threatening and the
client may feel they are under scrutiny. Eye contact must be used in
moderation, the counsellor needs to be relaxed and should not be
fidgeting or nervously engaging in distractive facial expressions.
Counsellors or health care providers need to realize that effective
communicationisatwowayprocessandshouldthereforebemindful
of the cues and messages that are expressed in the communication
feedback loop, at both the verbal and non-verbal levels.
220 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
Information gathering is facilitated when one:
· Asks one question at a time
· Looks at the client and  
· Communicates briefly and clearly
DO NOT ask questions to satisfy curiosity; instead use para -
phrasing to get more clarity. A paraphrase is a verbal statement
that when interchanged with that of the client still retains the
meaning or thought that is synonymous with what the client
said. In other words, the counsellor/health care provider repeats
back to the client the essence of what the client has said to him/
her. Paraphrasing is intended to promote discussion, show un -
derstanding of the verbal content of the client's story and check
ones understanding of the story.
Counselling for HIV Testing
Provider initiated Testing and Counselling (PITC)
· It is offered by a health care provider when the client seek -
ing medical care is ill and is likely to have an AIDS-related
illness.
· It can be provided by healthcare providers who are not
necessarily trained as counsellors.
· The primary focus is on diagnosing HIV for medical man -
agement.
· Counselling for psychosocial issues is addressed by ancillary
providers (e.g., social workers).
· The client is not necessarily expecting to get tested for HIV
and the first user of the test result is the health provider
who uses the HIV test to make the diagnosis and provide
appropriate treatment and/or referral.
· Counselling is conducted in a health care setting using a
221
blend of both open and closed questions. This is because the
session may not be as long as it is during standard VCT so
the counsellor will be more focused in her/his approach.
· The counsellor focuses on coping with the HIV positive
test result and positive prevention with little time spent on
those who are HIV negative.
· Care of HIV positive clients is coordinated between TB and
HIV providers who are referred to other support services,
some of which are provided in the community.
· Services provided are confidential and documented in medi -
cal records to ensure continuity of care.
· The most common method is one-on-one information/
counselling with a provider or trough group information
sessions in high volume settings (high client load).
· Clients retain the right to decline the HIV test without be -
ing denied any services to which they are entitled to at the
health facility.
· Services provided include basic prevention, treatment and
care and support within the facility or in the vicinity of the
facility.
Client-initiated Voluntary HIV
Counselling and Testing
· The individual voluntarily chooses to seek HIV counselling
and testing.
· The individual expects to be tested and is the primary user
of the HIV test result aimed at making personal life deci -
sions.
· The counselling gives focus predominantly on addressing
risk behavior and risk reduction as it aims to prevent HIV
transmission through risk reduction.
222 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
· The services offered are either anonymous or confidential
services and may be offered by a health care provider.
· Client-centered counselling is often offered as a one-on-one
session lasting between 45 minutes to one and a half hour.
Group sessions are very rare.
· In client initiated VCT, counsellors often use open-ended
rather than close-ended questions during their counselling
sessions.
· Post testing counselling is equally important for clients who
test HIVnegative as it is for those who test HIV positive
because of the focus on preventing acquisition of infection.
· HIV positive clients are referred to medical care services and
other support services, some of which are in the community.
Adherence Counselling
For a summary of core areas in adherence management and
lifestyle counselling please refer to Chapter 2.
When a client accesses the CTC for the first time it is important
that information be provided that will encourage a life-long
partnership between the client and CTC staff. Clients need
to be informed about what to expect when they visit the CTC,
including whom they will see and when, and if possible the average
time they should expect to spend at the CTC for each visit. This
will allow them to adequately prepare for clinic appointments.
During these meetings the triage nurse should:
· Review the CTC1 form with the client and ensure that the
client's information is filled out completely and accurately.
· Consent for HIV/AIDS care and treatment for adults:
Where it is the policy of the CTC to have prior consent,
the triage nurse should start the informed consent process
223
by providing information on what to expect from the CTC
services, the risks and benefits of ART as well as the voluntary
and life-long nature of ART care and treatment. An informed
consent form should then be filled out and signed including
for home visiting. The former consent is compulsory while
the latter is optional.
· Consent for HIV/AIDS care and treatment for minors:
Consent for children below the age of 18 years should be
provided by a guardian. Consent is compulsory for minors
below the age of 16 years. Where the care provider is also
living with HIV or AIDS, such a provider should be encour -
aged to provide the name and contact of an alternative care
provider that can bring the child for care in the event that
the primary care provider is unable to do so. Older adoles -
cents aged 16-17 years who have attended the CTC on their
own and have already tested for HIV can be considered as
emancipated minors, and assessment of their maturity and
readiness to start ARV drugs can be initiated. However,
they should be encouraged to inform an adult relative or
guardian about their HIV serostatus and their decision to
access CTC services.
· Where there is no guardian or parent or where a child is an
emancipated minor, initial treatment may be initiated while
looking for a treatment assistant to support ART therapy.
· Consent for HIV/AIDS care and treatment for vulnerable
persons that are mentally challenged: Issues of consent for
care and treatment for persons with a mental disorder and/
or mentally handicapped persons that are acutely ill and/
or unable to provide informed consent for ART care and
treatment will be addressed when these persons are mentally
stable or by an identified relative overseeing the person's
224 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
health care. Where such a relative does not exist, social
welfare officers should be contacted to address available legal
frameworks that will allow for supervised access to care and
treatment for such persons (the power of attorney to make
decisions on behalf of the client). The identified relative or
person with the power of attorney will also need to commit
to attending all clinic visits with the client; to the client's
readiness to start ART using existing clinical, immunologi -
cal and psychosocial criteria; to being on hand to monitor
adherence in the home; and to work with mental health
services to this effect using a case management approach.
· For children above the age of 7 years, health care providers
should work with the primary care provider in the home to
develop strategies for disclosing to the child his/her HIV
serostatus. Evidence shows it is feasible to do so after the
age of 7 years as it gives the child the ability to participate in
his/her care early and also helps to ensure good adherence.
· Where informed consent is provided for home visiting, the
triage nurse should complete a detailed locating information
form (map cue) that has the client's unique CTC identifica -
tion number derived from the pre-numbered CTC 1 form.
Counselling for treatment adherence
Formal treatment adherence support can be either clinic based
or community home-based.
Formal Clinic Adherence Support
This kind of support entails:
· The provision of consistent messages to client regarding ARV
drug adherence. This is done by triage nurses, counsellors,
doctors and pharmacists.
225
· Repeating messages regarding adherence at every clinic
visit.
· Working in partnership with clients to develop plans for
using ARV drugs as prescribed that fit in their lifestyle and
a system to monitor the implementation of these plans.
· Working with clients and their treatment assistants by sup -
porting a process of disclosure and identifying a treatment
assistant if one has not been identified. It should be noted
that the presence of an identified treatment assistant is not
a criteria for initiating ARV drugs. This means that clients
with no treatment assistant who have been assessed and are
ready to start should be provided access to ARV drugs.
· Learning from clients about the potential drug, clinical,
environmental and individual barriers to adherence and
using problem-solving approaches to either help clients to
overcome the barriers or advocate for changes that will remove
external barriers that are not under the client's control. This
requires a certain level of flexibility in the service and the
ability of health care providers to move beyond the traditional
hospital-based focus of health care that HIV demands.
· Adherence monitoring systems at facility level, including pill
counts, assessment of the level of adherence at every visit,
and periodic operational research for objective evaluation
of adherence such as unannounced pill counts.
Formal Community Home-based Support
Formal community home-based support requires:
· The presence of an active home-based care programme.
· Activelinkageswithcommunity-basedprogrammesforthecare
and support of persons living with HIV/AIDS as evidenced
by negotiated and written referral systems and/or the contract -
226 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
ing out of clinical and other support activities that cannot be
conducted in the setting of the CTC. These services include
among other things to and fro referral links to HIV/AIDS
voluntary counselling and testing services, PMTCT services,
mental health services, as well as links to psychosocial services
that support positive living for PLHAs in the form of post-test
support groups, adherence support groups, legal aid, transport
support, food aid and income generating support.
Given the importance of adherence counselling, all CTC staff
providing direct services to clients (doctors/prescriber, nurses,
counsellors, pharmacists, phlebotomists, laboratory technicians,
and home-based care providers) should receive training using
recommended national curricula. The training should cover
among other things, ART care and treatment, advanced adher -
ence counselling (supported by provision of adherence tool kits)
and HIV/AIDS home-based care training.
Specific guidelines for counsellors who are the first contact for
adherence counselling for CTC clients are noted below. The
guidelines are organized to address issues that should be done
at each of the visits prior to the initiation of ARV drugs and at
each subsequent follow-up visit.
The counsellor's role during the first CTC visit will include:
· A review of a client's basic knowledge on HIV infection and
development of AIDS and correction of misconceptions.
· Areviewofaclient'sunderstanding onhowHIVistransmitted
andhowARVdrugsaffectHIVtransmissionriskandprovision
of information where gaps in understanding are evident.
· The provision of information on the monitoring of the HIV
disease with particular focus on the implication of CD4
227
lymphocyte counts and viral load levels, to make sure that
these are well understood by the client. Adherence counsel -
ling aids/brochures should be used for demonstration.
· A discussion of ART as a lifelong treatment.
· The provision of information on the strictness of treatment
adherence in ART while emphasizing that adherence to rec -
ommended treatment regimens should be greater than 95%.
Reviewing with client their previous adherence practices to
medical recommendations and providing practical examples of
what adherence greater than 95% would mean for the client.
· Establishing whether a client has identified a treatment as -
sistant, documenting such information in the counselling
log book, and encouraging the client to attend his or her
next clinic session with the identified treatment assistant.
· For clients who have not disclosed their HIV serostatus to
anyone outside health care-providing staff, exploring with
the client the advantages and disadvantages of sharing their
test results; addressing barriers to disclosure and developing
with the client a disclosure plan that should be documented
in the counselling log book for supportive follow-up visits.
· During lifestyle assessment, discussing HIV transmission risks

Guidelines under this section will address follow-up visits after
initiating ARV drugs. The nurse counsellor will:
· Review and document the client's understanding of the
ARV drugs prescribed and the dosing. Some tips to assess
adherence from self report include:
o Using a model (of all ARV drugs available at a clinic) to
help the care provider or adolescent client to identify
types of drugs used, number used each time and timing
of use rather than referring to the last prescription.
o Checking prescribed medication to see if it matches the
client's reported drug use.
o Discussing and correcting any misunderstanding of how
drugs should be taken, the timing, the number of pills and
whether they should be taken with or without meals.
· Explore missed doses with the care provider or adolescent
client and document the number of missed doses since the
last visit.
o Explore the number of missed doses of each drug in
the past week and the past month. Establish % of total
drugs prescribed taken in the past month and document
if level of adherence at >95% or not.
o Review the client's understanding of ART as a lifelong
treatment and ARV drugs as treatment and not a cure
for AIDS.
o Review knowledge of reasons for the need to take every
dose as prescribed using pamphlets where available to
illustrate the relationship between missing doses and
the development of ARV drug resistance.
· Explore and document side effects from ARVs and other drugs.
o Review information on first line ART regimen and ex -
232 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
plore experiences with positive effects and side effects.
o Discuss with the care provider or adolescent client strate -
gies to minimize drug side effects.
· Explore factors that may prevent and those that may facilitate
correct use of drugs in the care provider or adolescent client's
environment and discuss with the care provider or adolescent
client possible solutions to barriers he/she identifies.
o Discuss drug storage in the home.
o Review with the care provider or adolescent client their
plan to take their ARV drugs as prescribed. Document
if any changes occur to previously agreed on plan.
o Discuss what the care provider or adolescent client will
do to ensure they have sufficient drugs in the event of
unexpected travel before their next clinic visit.
· Review disclosure and treatment assistants and document
the items that follow
o The outcome of the disclosure plan while encouraging or
formulating a new plan if disclosure has not occurred.
o The presence of a treatment assistant. Encourage the
care provider or adolescent client to identify a treatment
assistant if none has been identified.
· Preventive counselling including risk reduction and lifestyle
change counselling.
o Review implementation of risk reduction strategies and
encourage change or help care provider or client to plan
new strategies.
o Review implementation of agreed lifestyle changes and
encourage change or help care provider or adolescent
client to plan new strategies for change.
o Assess the mood state of the care provider or adolescent
client.
233
· Provide time for questions from care provider or adolescent
client and respond accordingly.
Checklists can and should be used in the CTCs to structure
adherence counselling sessions and for documentation of coun -
selling sessions. Using checklists and documenting counselling
sessions helps to improve the quality of counselling delivered as
it informs on areas that need to be strengthened through sup -
portive supervision and continued in service training. Counselling
checklists for children with their care providers and for ado -
lescents' counselling visits can be found in NACP Adherence
Toolkit, section 1.2.
Adherence Monitoring and Evaluation:
The Role of the Care and Treatment Team
Evidence indicates that adherence diminishes as time progresses
and therefore monitoring and support of adherence is essential.
Developing a trusting relationship between the client and mem -
bers of the health care team is also important. Optimal adherence
requires full participation by the health-care team as every client's
interaction represents an opportunity for reinforcement. The
need to stick to appointment dates needs particular emphasis as
this practice is not common everywhere. It is also important to
have close linkages between CTC-based and home-based care and
support activities to ensure a strong client tracking system that will
help to understand reasons for missed visits, loss to follow-up for
both clients on ARV drugs and those that are not yet eligible to
start ARV drugs. Supportive and non-judgmental attitudes by care
providers can foster client adherence practices.
The following are important considerations for care and treat -
ment team members:
234 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
· All care and treatment team members should show commit -
ment in dealing with their clients during clinic visits and
provide ongoing adherence monitoring and timely response
to adverse events or interim illnesses. Interim management
during clinician's absences must be clarified with the client.
· Adherence support must be intensified when problems arise.
This can be realized by investigating new barriers, schedul -
ing more frequent visits, involving home care programs,
enlisting the support of family/friends, reviewing teaching
or increasing the frequency of home visits.
· There is a need to work closely and in a supportive team
relationship with the rest of the staff (other clinicians at the
facility who are not primarily based in the CTC, adherence
counsellors, triage nurses, home-based care providers and
community based organizations providing care ad support)
to ensure all team members provide consistent messages
related to adherence to clients and their adherence assistants.
Adherence issues must be addressed at all visits and client's
and/or treatment assistants or care providers reminded to
come with their drug stocks at every visit.
· Pharmacy staff should include pill counts in their data base to
enhance the monitoring of adherence using self reporting. Pill
returncounts(i.e.,numberofdosesnottakenduringtheperiod)
are particularly important to capture clients who may not have
understood clearly their adherence instructions, such as not
stopping treatment even when they feel better or not taking
medication in correct dosages or frequency . Pill counts should
therefore be done at each client visit, but this should depend on
theclinicloadandcapacitytoundertakethisactivity.Atthevery
least, it should be done for the first three visits after initiation of
ARV drugs and thereafter at random. Pill counts may be done
235
before the client sees the doctor, and reviewed by the doctor
during the early/initial visits to evaluate adherence.
· SpecifictrainingregardingARTandadherenceshouldbeoffered
and updated periodically for all health care team members
· All health care team members should have in place systems
for adequate documentation of indicators for levels of ARV
drug adherence for individual clients under their care as well as
structuresforusingcollectedinformationtoassessperformance
at site level and feed-back for site-based supportive supervision,
refresher training as well as for centralized quarterly reporting
to district and regional levels as required.
Ideal adherence means a client must take more than 95% of his
or her pill doses (i.e. missing less than 3 doses in a month). If
a client is taking less than 95% of their pill doses, he or she are
at risk for developing viral resistance and ultimately treatment
failure. Client who take < 80% of their pill doses are unlikely
to have any durable viral suppression and should be targeted
urgently for adherence improvement, and 6 month follow-up.
All health care team members should adhere to the following
strategies:
· Spend time and have multiple encounters to explain goals
of therapy and need for adherence.
· Consider monitoring of medications such as Cotrimoxazole
or other surrogate medicines prior to ART initiation.
· Negotiate a treatment plan that clients can understand and
Pill counts are sometimes criticized because they are viewed as encouraging pill dumping
from clients who have not been adherent. While this is true, it is a crucial way of discover -
ing whether clients have understood their medication directions and the critical need for
proper adherence. For those clients who throw away their pills right before their clinic
visit, it is an indication that they do understand the directions and counselling given.
236 Chapter 12: Counselling related to HIV testing and Treatment Adherence
to which they commit.
· Encouragedisclosuretoidentifiedadherenceassistant(s)among
family or friends who can support the treatment plan.
· Inform the client beforehand of potential side effects includ -
ing their severity, duration and coping mechanisms.
· Establish "readiness" to take medications before ART initia -
tion.
· Provide adherence tools where available such as a written
calendar of medications, pill boxes, etc.
· Encourage use of alarms, pagers or other available mechanical
aids for adherence.
· Prevent adverse drug interactions by advising clients against
over-the-counter drugs and traditional medicines.
· Anticipate, monitor and treat side effects.
· Include adherence discussions in support groups.
· Develop links with community-based and home-based care
organizations to support adherence.
· Encourage participation in peer adherence support
groups.
An ideal (basic) adherence package at each visit should contain
or consider the following:
· Routine adherence discussion or education between the cli -
ent and the counsellor in form of an open-ended discussion
with time for questions and repetition. Missed/late clinic
visits should trigger concern about adherence.
· Feedback from treatment counsellors to the rest of the team
to get a better profile of the client and their environment.
· Encourage client participation in a support group.
· Continue monthly visit with treatment counsellors.
· Develop and document an individual adherence plan by
237
identifying daily activities that act as triggers such as fixed
broadcast programs or praying hours, to remind clients to
take their medication.
· When the adherence assessment is <80% at any visit, with
or without viral or clinical failure, the treatment counsellor
needs to re-educate the client and their adherence assistant
(close friends or family) about the importance of adherence.
The long-term benefits need to be re-emphasized.
· Evaluate the support structures in place. Are they appropriate?  
How can they be improved? What alternatives are there?
· Consider the use of pillboxes and/or a daily dosing diary.
· Insist on participation in a support group.
· Consider doing a psychological profile.
· Check the family situation through a social worker and
treatment counsellor.
· Assess effects of alcohol intake on adherence
· Assess use of traditional medicines and their potential effect
on ART adherence.
· Increase home visits by treatment counsellors to daily or
weekly at a minimum (conduct spot pill counts at home),
and consider directly observed therapy for an agreed period
of time.

Chapter 13: Management of
Mental Health Problems in HIV
and AIDS
Introduction
Mental disorders are more common in HIV-infected than in
non-infected people. In some instances, this is due to mental
conditions existing prior to the HIV infection (which increases
the risk of infection) while in other instances mental problems
are a direct or indirect consequence of the disease itself.
Some of the mental health symptoms of AIDS are:
· Depression, anxiety and abuse of alcohol and other sub -
stances
· Delirium, dementia and psychosis associated with viral and
opportunistic infections of the brain
· Psychiatric side effects of ARVs
· Social difficulties faced as a result of stigma and discrimina -
tion
· Exacerbation of a pre-existing mental disorders
Depression, anxiety disorders and substance abuse may be re -
lated to the stress of living with HIV and AIDS. Other mental
disorders may be secondary to neurological complications of
HIV, opportunistic infections or side effects of ARV drugs. They
include delirium with or without focal neurological signs or
with signs of meningial irritation and HIV-associated dementia.
Pre-existing mental disorders are associated with increased risk
of acquiring HIV. This group of patients often comes to ART
services with special management needs.
242 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
Primary Neurological Complications That Have
Secondary Mental Health Manifestations
Delirium
Definition
Delirium is a state of altered consciousness marked by anxiety,
incoherent or disorganized speech, disorientation and hallucina -
tions.Thedistinguishingfeaturesincludedrowsiness,lethargyanda
changinglevelofalertness.Thepersonhasdifficultieswithattention,
focusandjudgement,andtheremaybeperceptualdisturbancesuch
as seeing things that are not there. Children and adolescents may
presentwithdisruptiveoralteredbehavioursandmaybelessableto
describe their experiences. All these symptoms usually develop over
hours or days and the presentation fluctuates. Delirium is generally
a direct physiologic consequence of a medical condition.
Importance
The diagnosis of delirium should be considered first when one
meets with acute onset of disturbed consciousness. Delirium may
be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. It
often occurs in patients with severe medical illness, pre-existing
dementia, substance intoxication/withdrawal and acute head
injury. Delayed diagnosis and management of delirium can be
fatal. When assessing children and adolescents, family members
can be very helpful in alerting the clinical staff to the unusual
nature of their child's behaviours.
Epidemiology
As many as 30%-40% of hospitalized AIDS patients develop
delirium and up to 80% of patients with terminal illnesses
including AIDS patients develop delirium near death. The
rate is higher in elderly persons with AIDS. Most critically, the
mortality rate of patients with delirium can be high.
243
Risk Factors
Risk factors for developing delirium include:
· Advanced stages of immunosuppression
· Substance use/intoxication
· Head/brain injuries
· Previous episodes of delirium
· HIV-associated dementia or infections and malignancies of
the CNS
· Drug interactions in AIDS patients taking multiple medica -
tions
· Drug overdose (accidental or deliberate)
· High fever from any cause
· Intoxication from any cause
Among children and adolescents, delirium caused by medica -
tions may be more common, especially when there is a lack of
paediatric formulations of medications.
Diagnostic Features
Onset is usually acute, over hours or days. The patient ap -
pears disoriented and struggles to understand surroundings
because of clouded thinking and diminished awareness. The
disturbance tends to fluctuate during the course of the day.
Delirium in HIV-infected patients can present with a spectrum
that includes: labile affect; impairments of memory, attention,
and orientation; difficulty with logical thinking; and impaired
judgment. Thinking and language may be affected by decreased
verbal fluency. Patients may also be over talkative. Characteristic
perceptual disturbances are visual hallucinations and illusions
(misinterpretation of visual cues, such as mistaking shadows for
people). The HIV-infected patient may present with impaired
244 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
psychomotor functions, which may be in the form of decreased
activity, increased activity or a mixture of both. The patient may
show daytime lethargy and night-time agitation with an altered
sleep cycle. When delusions are present they are often paranoid
and episodic. Neurological abnormalities that have been reported
in these patients include tremors, ataxia, myoclonus, cranial
nerve palsies, asterixis, cerebellar signs and nystagmus.
Differential Diagnosis
Delirium is often misdiagnosed as a primary psychiatric disorder.
When patients appear hypoactive, depression is a frequent mis -
diagnosis for delirium. Clinicians should maintain a high level
of suspicion for delirium related to CNS infections, substance
including alcohol use, and among HIV-infected patients, multiple
medication interactions and/or toxicity.
Acute Management
The appropriate treatment of delirium involves interventions to
search for and correct underlying causes of delirium, as well as
relieve current symptoms. Joint and coordinated management
of the patient with delirium by the doctor, medical assistants,
other primary care or specialty clinicians will frequently help
ensure appropriate comprehensive evaluation and care.
Identifying the Aetiology
An essential principle in the psychiatric management of delirium
is the identification and correction of the aetiologic factors.
Careful review of the patient's medical history and interview
of family members or others close to the patient may provide
some direction.
Appropriate laboratory and radiological investigations may be
necessary to determine the underlying cause(s) of delirium. The
245
choice of specific tests to be undertaken will depend on the
results of the clinical evaluation. Common differentials for new
onset seizures include cryptococcal meningitis, toxoplasmosis,
and a cerebral lymphoma. Central nervous system causes include
space occupying lesions, cerebral tuberculosis, brain abscess,
cryptococcal infection, toxoplasmosis, bacterial and fungal
meningitis. If excessive alcohol use with features suggestive of
dependence on alcohol has been reported to be a problem, the
possibility of alcohol withdrawal syndrome due to relative or
total reduction in alcohol use should also be ruled out.
HIV Associated Dementia (HAD)
Definition
HAD is an acquired impairment of intellectual/cognitive abili -
ties in a sufficient degree of severity to interfere with social or
occupational functioning where memory impairment is a pre -
dominant feature. Other cognitive functions (such as attention,
learning, information processing, language, reasoning, judgment)
are also often affected with behavioural and personality changes
that significantly affect the individuals quality of life. There is
no clouding of consciousness in HAD.
Epidemiology
In the United States, before highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) came into existence, 40-60 percent of HIV-infected
people used to develop HAD. Now, it is estimated that only
7-27% of people infected with HIV develop HAD. However,
cognitive impairment is still the most common CNS complica -
tion of HIV infection. Contrary to earlier beliefs, recent reports
indicate that HAART does not seem to decrease the prevalence
of HAD, however when viral suppression occurs, cognitive
performance improves. HAD is also said to be more serious in
246 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
people above 60 years of age and takes a more fluctuating course
in older people than in younger age groups.
Risk Factors
It is well known that not all patients infected with HIV develop
HAD. Older age and increased level of immunodeficiency are
known risk factors for the development of HAD. In the pre
HAART era, HAD almost always occurred in cases whose CD4
count was less than 200 cells/l, whose viral load was significantly
elevated. However, recent observations indicate that cases with
low CD4 count and very low viral load also develop HAD.
There seems to be growing evidence that HAART does not
prevent neuropsychological impairment but may alter the type
of impairment experienced and delay the onset of dementia.
Diagnosis of HAD
HAD can produce different combinations of progressive cognitive
decline, motor dysfunction, affective changes and behavioural
abnormalities. Generally, cognitive and motor symptoms occur
early and include word-finding difficulty, forgetfulness, psycho -
motor slowing and diminished writing or visual/motor skills.
But, HAD shows a highly variable clinical course and spectrum
of signs and symptoms, ranging from subtle cognitive, affective
behavioural and motor impairments to profound dementia.
Seizures, global cognitive deterioration, mutism, incontinence,
and severe confusion are other common clinical features of
late-stage HAD.
Clinical Manifestations of HIV-associated Dementia
(HAD)
Affective impairment is usually in the form of apathy, irritabil -
ity and sometimes manic symptoms (new onset psychosis).
247
Behavioural changes include psychomotor retardation (slowed
speech and response time), personality change and social with -
drawal. Common cognitive changes include lack of visuo-spatial
memory (misplacing things), poor visuo-motor coordination,
and difficulty with complex sequencing (difficulty in perform -
ing previously learned complex tasks), impaired verbal memory
(word-finding ability), impaired concentration and attention.
Patients will often show motor changes such as unsteady steps,
loss of balance due to leg weakness, dropping things, tremors,
poor handwriting and decline in motor skills.
Differential Diagnosis
The early stage of HAD may be subtle in its presentation causing
difficulty to distinguish it from other primary psychiatric disor -
ders including substance use disorders, intoxication and alcohol
withdrawal. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease, which is a cortical
dementia, HAD is a sub-cortical dementia. Clinicians should
exclude other treatable, reversible causes of change in mental
status such as CNS opportunistic infections and malignancies
before a diagnosis of HAD can be made. Cognitive impairment
may occur as an accompanying feature of a depressive episode.
The term pseudo dementia is used to describe this clinical
presentation, which resolves with appropriate treatment of the
depressive disorder.
Investigations
Take a thorough history, inquiring about medications, time of
onset and course of symptoms, drug and alcohol use, oppor -
tunistic infection symptoms, HIV history, including duration,
opportunistic infections, and CD4 levels. Physical/neurological
examination should include checking temperature and other
vital signs, thorough physical and neurological examination
248 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
to determine potential reversible causes such as opportunistic
infections. MRI/CT scans can exclude other CNS disorders
(where available).
Diagnostic Tests
Commonly requested tests are: FBC with differential, serum
analysis, serological tests for syphilis, serum B12 and folate
(where available), and CD4 count. A lumbar puncture may be
necessary to rule out acute infection, such as bacterial meningitis,
cryptococcal meningitis, and toxoplasmosis.
Acute Treatment
ARV medication should be continued. In addition to treatment
of the existing opportunistic infections, use antipsychotic medi -
cations to treat agitation and hallucinations. Because patients
with HAD are sensitive to anticholinergic side effects and
extrapyramidal symptoms, antipsychotic medications should be
given in low dose and increased slowly while carefully monitor -
ing side effects and treatment response. Giving haloperidol 1-2
mg per day with slow increase in the dosage depending on the
response would control agitation and some delusional beliefs.
If available, atypical antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine and
risperidone can be used starting with low doses. For patients on
ritonavir, use with caution as increased or decreased levels of
psychotropics may occur. Avoid benzodiazepines, which tend
to increase confusion and decrease concentration.
Long-term Treatment
Involve family members/treatment assistants in both medication
management and attending clinics and educate them about HAD.
Assess independent functioning in the home and refer to home-
based care when assistance in care is indicated. Advance attention
249
should be paid to living wills, health care proxies and durable
power of attorney to allow patients to make decisions about their
treatment and lives before they become too ill to do so.
AIDS-Related Mania
Definition and Characteristic Features
AIDS-related mania is thought to be secondary to HIV CNS
involvement and affects about 4% of clinic patients. It is charac -
terized by loss of the ability to control mood, and presents with
elated or irritable moods (either occurring acutely or sub-acutely),
increased activity and energy regardless of physical status, de -
creased need for sleep and an exaggerated sense of self-importance.
Behavioural changes centre around increased activity, perceived
increased energy, intrusiveness and uninhibition. The condition
occurs with more advanced immunosuppression and is often
associated with HIV related cognitive impairments.
Management
ART treatment relieves the symptoms of AIDS-related mania. In
the Tanzanian context, mood stabilizing drugs such as sodium
valporate (used at doses for treatment of epilepsy) have been
noted to be useful for the control of acute symptoms in patients
that are on ARV.
Other antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine and lamotrigine
are also powerful mood stabilizers. When carbamazepine is pre -
scribed, drug doses should be adjusted within one-two weeks of
treatment as carbamazepine induces liver enzymes and increases
its own metabolism as well as that of other drugs metabolised in
the liver such as ART drugs. If possible, they should be avoided
in patients on ART.
250 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
Primary Mental Health Complications
In the absence of focal neurological deficits or meningitis, pri -
mary mental health complications should be considered when
changes in mental status occur. The most common primary
mental health complications that can occur at any CD4 level are
adjustment disorder, depression, mixed depression and anxiety,
and anxiety disorders. A syndromal diagnosis should be made
for all these conditions.
Adjustment Disorder
This condition occurs predominantly at the time of HIVD (HIV
disease) diagnosis and the disorder includes acute and chronic
adaptation responses to HIVD diagnosis. These responses include
fear of discrimination and imminent death, guilt over infecting
others, exacerbation of existing mental health conditions and
acute suicidal ideation. With HIVD progression, patients also
need to adapt to changes in their lives brought about by each
new symptom and loss event such as death of an intimate partner
or child as a result of an AIDS-related condition. The nature of
the adaptation response will influence the patient's ability to
· Disclose his or her sero-status to others. HIV-related self
stigmatization has been noted to be a major barrier to sharing
test results and hence prohibiting access to social support
that may protect patients from many other mental health
consequences of HIVD
· Adopt safer sexual practices
· Adopt safer infant feeding options for postnatal mothers
· Access medical and mental health care
· Define those involved in his or her care.
251
Management
Supportive medical/clinical counselling is the mainstay of more
positive adaptive responses to HIVD diagnosis. Issues to consider
during counselling following loss and crisis are noted below.
Addressing Loss and Crisis Amongst PLHAs
Definition
Bereavement is defined as the state of perceived loss that often
results from knowing that one has HIV. Adjusting to the new
status of living with HIV is often very stressful.
Assessing for Loss, Bereavement and Crisis
This involves exploring the losses that the PLHA has experi -
enced. There are six stages of bereavement. These are: shock,
denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. Among
PLHAs the spectrum of loss often begins with the knowledge
of their HIV positive diagnosis and consequent loss of their
health, certainty, future hopes, relationships, lifestyles, and loss
of hopes for children. PLHAs are also more likely to experience
the loss of loved ones such as partners and their own children
from AIDS defining conditions.
A crisis may be generated by a person's response to rapid disrup -
tion of personal affairs. Examples can include the break up of an
intimate relationship, the aftermath of an earthquake, rape or other
forms of assault. A crisis situation is a critical situation in which a
person is unable to use his/her normal problem solving techniques
to resolve a problem. When a crisis occurs it is overwhelming for
the individual both emotionally and cognitively, and in the case of
HIV and AIDS, the triggers that lead to crisis might be death of
another PLHA, emergence of a new symptom, treatment failure or
anything that is perceived by the patient as a severe life event.
252 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
Management
Management is through bereavement counselling. This is a form
of supportive counselling with the objective of identifying with
the patient, loss events and responses to these events as well as
aiding the process of acceptance and constructive adaptation.
A crisis situation takes the form of a blow, withdrawal and
acceptance, and as with loss events, is best managed through
counselling. Note: Health care workers are encouraged to refer
to a manual on HIV and AIDS counselling for issues related to
different aspects of counselling.
Anxiety Disorders
The initial fear accompanying an HIV diagnosis tends to subside
and then persist at a lower level. When anxiety symptoms are
severe or persistent, patients may have any of the following anxiety
disorders: panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Symptoms
of anxiety disorders are both psychological and physical due to
physiological arousal. The wide range of physiological manifesta -
tions include: shortness of breath, chest pain, racing/pounding
heart, dizziness and gastrointestinal disturbances, which may
overlap with symptoms of other common medical disorders. In
addition, patients present with fear, worry, insomnia, impaired
concentration and memory, diminished appetite, compulsive
rituals and avoidance of situations that make them anxious.
Diagnosis
An anxiety disorder occurs when symptoms interfere with a
patient's daily functions, personal relationships and cause marked
subjective distress.  Even brief episodes of anxiety, such as those
occurring during a panic attack may interfere markedly with a
253
patient's life and warrant diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Anxiety
disorders are differentiated from adjustment disorders by the lack
of a clear precipitant, and from major depression by the absence
of somatic features of depression. CNS pathologies, metabolic
illnesses (e.g., hypoxia), endocrinopathies, and respiratory and
cardiovascular conditions may also mimic (resemble) anxiety
disorders and should be ruled out.
Management
General measures that help in the treatment of persons with
anxiety disorders include reassurance, psycho education and sup -
portive counselling when the level of anxiety does not interfere
significantly with social or occupational functioning.
Medications are used when anxiety interferes significantly with
sleep or daily functioning. In such cases, the patient's fears should
be discussed in an empathic manner in subsequent sessions
and the patient informed that medication will be provided for
a short time to help decrease the intensity of symptoms until
they can cope better. Amitriptyline 25 mg daily may alleviate
the symptoms.
Persons with anxiety disorders should be encouraged to join
psychosocial support groups--i.e., support groups where people
with common concerns and needs can share their experiences
and help each other through difficult periods and therefore
achieve better health and well being.
Major Depressive Disorder
Definition and Importance
Depression is a common mood disorder characterised by low or
sad mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt, suicidal
thoughts, disturbed sleep, appetite and weight changes, poor
254 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
attention and concentration, changes in energy level/fatigue
and psychomotor disturbances. Behavioural changes may alert
a physician about possible depression including; change in
treatment adherence, inability to make life/medical care choices,
preoccupation with minor problems, change in functioning,
social isolation, interpersonal problems, difficult behaviours
in the medical setting, or initiation/return to substance use.
Patients may be reluctant or unable to recognize their depressed
mood that should be recognized by the attending health care
provider and reflected back to the patient.
Importance
Major depression is a mental disorder that affects the mind and
body and therefore presents with both psychological and physi -
cal symptoms. If untreated depression undermines adherence to
medical recommendations and physical survival. About 15% of
people that are depressed for more than a year commit suicide.
Suicide risk must be assessed and if moderate or high it should
be addressed accordingly.
Epidemiology
About 20% of PLHAs accessing medical services suffer from
depression. PLHAs have at lease twice the rate of depression
in the general population. Depression is associated with more
rapid progression of HIV and AIDS disease and is generally
more common among women compared to men.
Risk Factors
Risk factors of depression include:
· Past/Family history of depression
· Female gender
· Adverse life events
255
· Chronic medical illness including HIV/AIDS
· Lack of social support
Note: An adverse social environment is damaging while positive
social support is protective.
Diagnosis
Depressed mood and/or loss of the ability to experience pleasure
or interest in normal activities (anhedonia) must be present
for more than two weeks and cause significant difficulties in
normal functioning (inability to attend to schooling, work or
household chores).
Any four of the following also need to be present for a diagnosis
of depression:
· Excessive worry, with or without physiological symptoms
of anxiety
· Fatigue or loss of energy experienced more on waking up
in the morning; psychomotor retardation (taking a longer
time than usual to accomplish tasks or make decisions)
· Unexplained pain (headaches, backache, chest tightness or
pain when swallowing, generalized body malaise/aches and
pains often reported as "homa")
· Sleep disturbances characterized by being unable to maintain
sleep or a terminal insomnia and/or disturbing dreams
· Decrease in sexual desire
· Decrease in attention and concentration
· Constipation and decreased appetite and weight loss
Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) may occur
with more severe forms of depression.
256 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
Diagnostic Challenges
· Misconception that depression in HIV is normal
· Overlapping symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss and
insomnia may be due to depression or physical illness, such
as HIV
· Chronic pain and chronic physical syndromes co-morbid
with mood disorders
· Medication related depression and anxiety
· Substance abuse (may be associated with depression)
Management
Antidepressants should be started in low doses, about 50% of
dosage for healthy individual of similar profile. PLHAs tend to
be more sensitive to the side effects of psychotropic medicines.
Always initiate treatment with low doses to minimize risk of
serious side effects. Tricyclic antidepressants can be used but
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine that
have fewer side effects are recommended. It is important to
ensure adequate doses and for adequate duration (maintenance
drug treatment provided at therapeutic dose for 6 months after
resolution of symptoms), combined with supportive counselling.
Referral to mental health services is advisable should depres -
sive symptoms not resolve within four weeks of initiating drug
treatment. Antidepressants do not treat psychotic symptoms
and when present they should be treated with an antipsychotic
drug.. Care should be taken for possible interactions between
antidepressants and ARVs as shown in the following table.

Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders
Definition and Importance (binge drinking, alcohol
abuse, and dependence)
The term "alcoholism" refers to a disease known as alcohol de -
pendence syndrome, the most severe stage of a group of drinking
problems which begins with social drinking, binge drinking and
alcohol misuse (hazardous use). Alcohol problems occur at differ -
ent levels of severity, from mild and annoying to life threatening.
Although alcohol dependence (alcoholism) is the most severe stage,
less severe drinking problems can also be dangerous.
Social drinking refers to casual collateral drinking, usually without
the intent to get drunk. It is variable depending on the social or
cultural group in question. Binge drinking means having five or
more drinks in one session for men and four or more for women, or
simply drinking to get drunk. This turns into alcohol misuse when
someone's regular drinking begins to cause problems and the drink -
ing becomes habitual. In spite of continued social, interpersonal or
legal difficulties the person continues to drink.
258 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
Alcohol Dependence
Alcohol misuse becomes alcohol dependence when drinkers
begin to experience a craving for alcohol, a loss of control of
their drinking, an increased tolerance to alcohol so that they
have to drink more to achieve the same effect and withdrawal
symptoms when they are not drinking. Alcohol dependence is
a chronic and often progressive disease that includes a strong
need to drink despite repeated problems.
Alcohol Use and HIV
Drug abusers have special clinical needs which require mental
health skills and sensitivity in terms of assessing patients' risk
behaviours and preparedness of HIV counseling and testing.
People who misuse alcohol are more likely to engage in HIV
transmission risk behaviours. For example, rates of injection drug
use are high among alcoholics in treatment, and increasing levels
of alcohol use are associated with greater injection drug­related
risk behaviours, including needle sharing. A history of heavy
alcohol use has been correlated with a lifetime tendency toward
high-risk sexual behaviours, including multiple sex partners, un -
protected intercourse, sex with high-risk partners (e.g., injection
drug users, prostitutes), and exchanging sex for money to finance
addiction. Bars and drinking parties serve as convenient social
settings for meeting potential sexual partners. Alcohol misuse
also occurs frequently among people whose lifestyle or personality
predisposes them to high-risk behaviours in general.
Studies show that decreasing alcohol use among HIV patients
not only reduces the medical and psychiatric consequences
associated with alcohol consumption but also decreases other
drug use/abuse and HIV transmission. Thus, alcohol and other
259
drug abuse treatment can also be considered primary HIV
prevention.
Diagnosis
Look for signs of alcohol dependence (alcoholism or addiction).
Does the patient's pattern of alcohol use lead to distress to self?
To others? Are there evidences of tolerance (reports of needing
to use larger amounts to become intoxicated) to alcohol and/or
avoidance of withdrawal symptoms by drinking in the mornings?
If yes to two of any of these questions, establish signs of strong
desire or compulsion to use alcohol and difficulty controlling
alcohol use.
Do you see withdrawal features? There is a history of recently
stopping or decreasing alcohol use after prolonged heavy drink -
ing, with two or more of the following a few hours or days
after stopping heavy use: tremor, sweating, increased pulse
rate (<100), insomnia, nausea and vomiting, anxiety, transient
visual or auditory hallucinations, psychomotor agitation and
grand mal seizures.
The above symptoms create distress and impair general function -
ing. Make sure the changes are not due to a physical illness or
another mental disorder.
Do you see hazardous alcohol use patterns and complications?
Hazardous alcohol use means repeated binge drinking or regular
alcohol abuse that leads to physical, psychological and social
complications.
Physical complications: They include peptic ulcer, gastritis,
pancreatitis, liver disease, ascites, hypertension, cancer, skin
changes, seizures, CNS degeneration, neuropathy, and malnu -
260 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
trition, proximal muscle wasting, impaired sexual functioning,
and lowered immunity, thrombosis, anaemia and cardiac com -
plications. Alcohol abusers are prone to accidents or injuries.
Dangerous drinking during pregnancy can lead to foetal alcohol
syndrome (babies are born with characteristic facial and brain
abnormalities).
Psychological complications: Look for signs of blackouts
(retrograde amnesia - inability to recall actions that occurred
when intoxicated), sleep fragmentation, personality change, poor
memory or concentration, delirium, Wernicke-Korsakoff syn -
drome, evidence of self-neglect (e.g., poor hygiene), failed treat -
ment for depressed mood, nervousness and insomnia. Sometimes
hazardous use of alcohol can lead to psychosis. Signs of alcohol
withdrawal are often overshadowed by psychological symptoms
such as sweating, tremors, and morning sickness coupled with
intense agitation and hallucinations.
Social complications: These include marital problems, domestic
violence, child abuse or neglect, missed work, various forms of
irresponsibility.
Differential Diagnosis
Symptoms of anxiety or depression may occur with heavy alcohol
use. Re-asses and manage symptoms of depression or anxiety
if symptoms continue after patient stops drinking. This means
the anxiety/depression could be a primary disorder.
Lowered immunity and other physical complications of HIV can
be associated with alcohol use. Alcohol increases susceptibility to
someinfectionsthatcanoccurascomplicationsofAIDS.Infections
associated with both alcohol and AIDS include tuberculosis;
pneumonia caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumonia;
261
and the viral disease Hepatitis C, a leading cause of death among
people with HIV. Alcohol may also increase the severity of AIDS-
related brain damage, which is characterized in its severest form by
profound dementia (see AIDS associated dementia).
Management
Information for patient and family: Alcohol dependence is an
illness with serious consequences. It complicates the manage -
ment of HIV and AIDS. In assessing readiness to start ARV
drugs the risk of non adherence related to alcohol use has to
be discussed with all patients. Stopping alcohol use will bring
mental and physical benefits, and make one eligible for ART
but since abrupt stopping when a patient is dependent can cause
withdrawal symptoms, medical supervision is necessary.
Treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and dependence:
Thiamine (150 mg per day in divided doses) should be given, if avail -
able,orallyforonemonth.Usediazepamforthreedays(day120mg,
day 210 mg, day 35 mg) in case of severe withdrawal symptoms.
Other Drugs
Reports from Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam show HIV rates of
around 30% among injection drug users. Rates among cannabis
and alcohol abusers are also above national average. Overall there
are more male drug users than females (about 4:1 respectively).
Even though this fact is less well appreciated, drug-using behaviors
may be a significant HIV transmission risk factor for many men
who do not inject drugs. A US study of homosexual men revealed
that up to 16% may have drug use as a risk factor for acquiring
HIV. The high degree of association between injection and
non-injection drug use underscores the importance of primary
care providers' being able to diagnose drug using behaviors.
262 Chapter 13: Management of Mental Health Problems in HIV and AIDS
Diagnosing drug dependence or addiction is not an easy task.
Many people who are addicted to drugs attempt to conceal or
deny that they have an addiction. In addition, diagnostic tests
for drug dependence and addiction lack specificity and sensitiv -
ity. Although blood and urine tests are usually quite reliable at
detecting recent drug use, individuals can be adept at avoiding
being tested or at manipulating test results.
Management
Assessment and support should be similar to what you do with
alcohol dependent persons. It is best to involve a mental health
expert in the management of the patient.
Primary Psychosis
Psychosis can be a manifestation of delirium, affective disorders,
or schizophrenia, but it can occur in the absence of these con -
ditions. Estimates of the prevalence of new-onset psychosis in
patients with HIV range from 0.5%-15%, which is higher than
in the general population. New-onset psychosis may also be a
manifestation of HIV-associated encephalopathy and a history
of substance abuse is also more common among patients with
psychosis.
Treatment for HIV-infected patients with psychosis follows the
same basic principles as for any other patient with schizophrenia,
namely, control of symptoms with medications and psychosocial
support and rehabilitation. Quite often, patients require long-
term treatment and require various antipsychotic medications
to control the delusions, hallucinations, and overall level of
disorganization. Because of the high sensitivity to antipsychotic
side effects, always start with low doses and if possible maintain
patients on half the required dosage for age and weight.
263
Counselling for HIV testing should be avoided when persons
with mental illness are acutely ill and too disorganized to take in
what they are being told. Given the importance of the partnership
required for risk reduction and other preventive interventions
in persons with HIVD, issues related to screening for HIV and
AIDS should be postponed until the person is mentally stable.
For persons with previous mental illness that are currently in
remission of acute symptoms, as with other clients seen at clinics,
risk reduction counselling and strategies should be addressed
at each counselling session. Monitoring drug treatments for
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder should prevent or decrease
relapse of episodes. When episodes do occur they should be
treated (Refer to Management of Mental Health Conditions in
Primary Care Settings (MEHATA publications) for treatment
guidelines). Referral to mental health services at the district
level should be made and a case management approach used
with such services.

Introduction
The Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (HSHSP)
2008-2012 calls for comprehensive quality HIV care services
at three levels, namely: facility, community and household.
Patients should have access to care at all three levels and an
effective referral system needs to be put in place to link all the
levels with each other. The availability and use of antiretroviral
treatment has reinforced and added new perspectives to this
concept of comprehensive care across a continuum. The im -
portance of compliance with treatment regimes and adherence
to treatment has resulted in new roles for Community Home
Based Care programmes (CHBC). CHBC has a key role in
treatment advocacy, information and literacy as well as moni -
toring and support to patients on antiretroviral drugs. Efforts
towards universal access to HIV prevention, care, treatment and
support for PLHAs provide critical opportunities to scale up
and strengthen CHBC. CBHC services also enhance HIV and
AIDS awareness, reduce stigma, and mobilize communities to
use HIV testing and counselling services.
PLHAs and their affected families and households have a variety
of needs beyond the mere clinical needs. Such needs include
psychological, spiritual, nutritional, educational, economic and
legal care and support. This is illustrated in Figure 14.1 on the
following page.
268 Chapter 14: Community and Home Based Care for People Living with HIV and AIDS
Figure 14.1: Comprehensive HIV and AIDS Care and Support
The care provided to PLHAs in their homes and communities
must therefore address the needs of not only the patients but
also their care givers and household and community members. In
order to effectively ensure networking and link patients across a
continuum of care services, an inventory or directory of service
providing organisations in the local community or district needs
to be available at all clinics and programmes. In addition, regular
coordination is needed between the CHBC programmes, com -
munity and district health authorities and CTC staff.
Definitions
Continuum of care is defined as care throughout all stages of
HIV and AIDS and is provided through a care delivery approach
that links health, medical and social support services within a
defined geographical area to comprehensively meet a wide and
evolving range of needs over time.
Home-based care is a form of assistance given to a sick person/
269
patient, within the home environment. Home-based care ser -
vices involve prevention and care and support provided beyond
the health institution that aims at meeting the overall needs of
people suffering from chronic illnesses and their family members,
including those taking life-long medications such as ARV drugs.
Palliative care is usually provided by the patient's family, friends,
volunteers and members of the community that are trained and
supported by skilled health care workers. The care given may
include physical, psycho-social, spiritual and material support
and should adapt to the patient's needs.
Palliative care contains a set of supportive interventions that
improve the quality of life of patients and their families who face
problems associated with a chronic disease or life-threatening
illness. This can be done through the prevention and relief of
the broad spectrum of suffering which could either be physical,
psychological or spiritual.
Coordination at the CTC
The main role of the HBC coordinator at the CTC of the facility
is to link patients attending the CTC to HBC services within
their community. The HBC coordinator maintains and updates
the HBC directory of services and keeps record of referrals.
The HBC coordinator liaises with community home-based
care (CHBC) programs and performs supervisory and moni -
toring duties. She/he forms the secretariat of the district-based
community home-based team (CHBT) or continuum of care
committee which should keep the council health management
team (CHMT) informed of its activities on a regular basis.
Functions of CHBC Committee
· To facilitate training of home- and community-based care
270 Chapter 14: Community and Home Based Care for People Living with HIV and AIDS
providers or volunteers and support them through regular
supportive supervision to ensure provision of quality pal -
liative care within homes.
· To mobilize resources (human and material through partner
organizations and individuals) and coordinate them towards
providing care for PLHAs and their families.
· To ensure that local community organizations and families
are involved before the patient is discharged in order to link
them with care in the community/home and to encourage
referral back to health institutions where indicated.
· To ensure networking of local stakeholders in order to provide
coordinated palliative care services.
· To promote treatment linked activities within HBC services
such as adherence and referrals.
Benefits of Home-based Care
Home-based care has the following important benefits to PLHAs,
their families and the community.
To PLHAs:
· Helps them to stay healthier longer
· Permits them to receive care and treatment in a familiar and
supportive environment
· Enhances adherence to ART
· Allows them to continue participating in family life matters
· Maintains a sense of belonging in social groups
· Maximizes their emotional health and thus keeps a positive
attitude
· Makes it easier for them to accept their condition
· Is cost saving
· Reduces stigma and discrimination
271
· Enables them to help others prevent new HIV infections
· They die at home amongst loved ones
To the family:
· Strengthens family ties/attachment
· Helps the family to accept the patient's condition
· Provides opportunity to learn about HIV and AIDS
· Can reduce medical and other care-related costs
· Makes it easier for family members who provide care to
PLHAs to attend to other responsibilities
· Makes it easier for the family to support the patient in taking
life long ART treatment as well as other medications
· Involvement of the family in care enables the grieving process
to be easier
To the community
· Promotes awareness about prevention of infection, care, treat -
ment and support of HIV and AIDS and thus helps to reduce
stigma
· Helps the community understand the disease and helps to
correct myths and misconceptions about HIV and AIDS
prevention and treatment
· Promotes ART preparedness and support
· Encourages sustainability of care services
· Makes it easier for the community to provide support by
tapping all possible resources in the community
· Helps to set up long-term care and other services in the
community
Components of Home-based Care
Home-based care is a mechanism of palliative care provision that
includes various components as elaborated below.
272 Chapter 14: Community and Home Based Care for People Living with HIV and AIDS
Physical Care
For this kind of care, providers should always
· Assess for TB: chronic cough, weight loss and night sweats.
Refer if needed
· Ensure that the patient gets treated for opportunistic infec -
tions and appropriate nursing care at all times
· Maintain preventive therapies such as CPT and IPT
· Provide ART monitoring for early side effects and continu -
ous adherence
· Administerpainreliefwithappropriatemedication(suchasuseof
NSAID's, codeine and other opoids such as liquid morphine)
· Support the prevention of malaria through use of insecticide
treated bednets (ITN)
· Offer reproductive health care such as family planning
advice, and referral and care for pregnant mothers (MTCT
interventions including during delivery at home).
Nutritional Care and Support
Patients should be educated on appropriate nutrition using
locally available foods, and guided on feeding patterns and
preparation of foods to suit the condition of the patient (for
details see Chapter 15, Nutrition, and Annex 7, The Role and
Sources of Selected Micronutrients).
Hygiene
Practical ways of encouraging hygiene, particularly personal
hygiene (e.g. mouth, skin and hair care) and environmental care
within the household and outside including garbage disposal
should be promoted. Patients should be encouraged as much
as possible to do their own hygiene care as far as possible so as
to maintain their self respect and hope. Nursing care should be
273
reserved for only what is necessary for the patient in order to
maintain the dignity and comfort of the patient.
Exercises
Patients need to exercise regularly and if they are too weak the
HBC providers or family members should assist them in doing
passive exercises for body movement and to enhance blood
circulation thus reducing the risks of complications such as bed
sores and pulmonary problems.
Caring for chronically ill persons and PLHAs must always consider
prevention of spread of infection to protect the patients and those
around them. Hand washing, care of the nails, keeping the body,
clothing and bed linen clean, care of sores and broken skin, proper
storage of food and observing cleanliness in handling food are some
of the ways in which infection can be prevented. Gloves should
be worn when the care giver is handling any type of body fluids or
waste or when the patient or care giver has an open wound that will
come in contact with the other person.
Emotional Support
Persons suffering from any chronic or terminal illness usually
have a lot of fear and worries. Care givers should therefore help
them to ventilate and talk about their condition and concerns.
Emotional support helps to reduce stress and anxiety and pro -
motes positive living including adherence to treatment.
Social Support
Patients may suffer from loneliness and neglect aggravated by
stigma and even discrimination within the household or com -
munity. Care givers should interact with patients and household
members to promote their involvement in social interactive and
recreational activities. Patients should be encouraged to form
274 Chapter 14: Community and Home Based Care for People Living with HIV and AIDS
and or join PLHA groups for social support.
Spiritual Support
Addressing spiritual needs is an important aspect in any type of
palliative care. Chronically ill patients often lose hope and reason
to continue living which is often relieved through reassurance
and spiritual care. Faith-based organizations and religious leaders
in the community should be involved in HBC programs.
Legal Support
Patients should be informed about how and where to get legal aid
that they may need especially for matters concerning inheritance,
writing of wills and human rights-related issues.
Economic Support
When a person is diagnosed with HIV or has AIDS, the financial
burden to the family increases given the resulting additional
transport and medical expenses. If the affected party is the main
bread earner, this further constrains the limited family resources
available. It is therefore necessary for home-based care givers to
be aware of economic support networks and income generating
projects and link PLHAs to them.
Palliative Care
Palliative care aims at:
· Providing comfort and enhancing quality of life
· Providing relief from pain and other distressing symptoms
· Integrating psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care
· Enhancing the quality of life, and may also positively influ -
ence the course of illness
· Offering a support system to help patients live as actively as
possible
275
· Offering a support system to help the family cope during
the patient's illness
· Usingateamapproachtoaddresstheneedsofpatientsandtheir
families, including bereavement counselling, if indicated
· Affirming life as it regards dying as a normal process
· Neither hastening nor postponing death
Palliative care can be provided to in-patients in a hospital, at
clinics or health centres, or within a home care program.
Many aspects of palliative care, such as pain management, symptom
control and psychological support are applicable early in the course
of the illness and therefore the palliative care needs of persons
with AIDS vary from person to person and from illness to illness.
When patients choose to be cared for at home, care givers can be
trained to effectively provide the prescribed palliative medications
and other physical and psychological support.
Symptom Management
Pain
Determine the site of the pain and grade the severity of the pain.
Pain control in adults should be achieved as follows:
Initially use non-opioids such as aspirin 600 mg every 4 hours,
increasing to 1,000 mg every 6 hours, or paracetamol 500 mg
every 4 to 6 hours, or ibuprofen 400 mg every 6 hours.
The next level of treatment for pain control is with a mild opioid
such as codeine given in a dose of 30mg every 4 hours. If this still
does not control pain then a strong opioid such as oral morphine
may be used initially in a dose of 5mg every 4 hours. This dose
should be increased to levels that control pain.
276 Chapter 14: Community and Home Based Care for People Living with HIV and AIDS
Chronic pain should be treated on a regular basis. It is advisable
to start with mild analgesia and progress in a step-wise to more
potent analgesics and opioids if necessary. The pain control
"ladder" is shown in Figure 14.2
Figure 14.2: Achieving pain control in persons with chronic pain
Breathlessness
Persons with AIDS often develop severe breathlessness that can be
terminal. This may be the result of a severe non-responding lung
infection or cancer such as Kaposi's sarcoma or lymphoma affecting
thelungsandpleura.Insuchpatientsalleviatedyspnoeabypropping
up the patient and then refer for further management.
Vomiting
Vomiting may lead to poor fluid intake and hence dehydration
and it may be necessary to correct dehydration. Patients should be
encouraged to take small amounts of fluids frequently. Vomiting
277
may be relieved by administering promethazine 25 mg PO TID
or metoclopromide 10mg PO TID.
Oral Care
Good oral care should always be practiced. This includes regular
teeth brushing with a soft toothbrush and gargling with mouth
wash solutions or weak salt solutions after food. Oral care helps
for persons with mouth sores. If the sores are painful the patient
will not be able to eat or swallow and should be given soft foods
and liquid diets. If a specific cause for the ulcers is found they
should be treated as described.
Itching
To relieve itching, bath oils or other emollients such as emulsify -
ing ointment may be used. If a rash is present then antifungal
creams will help if the rash is due to a fungal infection or topical
steroids to relieve inflamed areas of the skin if a bacterial or viral
infection is not present. Orally administered antihistamines, such
as, chlopheniramine (piriton) 2 mg PO given at night may reduce
the pruritus and allow a relatively more comfortable sleep.
Comfort
Prevent the development of bedsores by changing the position of
the patient every 4 hours and arrange for the patient to lie on an
extra soft material. Avoid pressure on any one part of the body
for prolonged periods of time. Protect areas that have become
inflamed because of pressure by avoiding any pressure at all on
the area and by applying soothing lotions. Change soiled bed
sheets immediately. Massage pressure points such as the heels,
elbows, ankles, back and hips frequently. Cover all open sores
with a gauze bandage after applying an antiseptic cream.
Terminal Care
278 Chapter 14: Community and Home Based Care for People Living with HIV and AIDS
The main aim of terminal care providers should be to improve
the quality of life by removing or alleviating unpleasant symp -
toms and helping to prevent the patient from suffering, fear or
loneliness. Quality care must be provided wherever the patient
is, be it at home or in the hospital. Nowadays, because of the
home-based care approach for HIV and AIDS, many patients
are dying at home. As part of the continuum of care, health care
providers are expected to extend their services by training and
supporting family members to ensure that terminally ill patients
at home are well cared for.
All persons with terminal illnesses need end-of-life care. Towards
the end of their life it is essential that patients and their families
have access to social, emotional and spiritual support. Palliative
care in terminal illness allows the patient to die with dignity and
relieve him/her of distressing symptoms. Palliation also offers
support to help the patient live as actively as possible until death
and enables the family to cope with their loved-one's illness and
with their own bereavement. The care provider needs to listen
with empathy and should encourage communication within the
family. Issues such as family and child support, schooling and
welfare should be discussed. The patient should be constantly
told that they are loved and will be missed by family members.
Spiritual support and discussion with a religious leader may help
to relieve feelings of guilt. The care provider should be available
and should visit regularly and bereavement counselling be made
available to family members including children.
Care of the Deceased
Care after death is part and parcel of comprehensive HIV and
AIDS care. Standard precautions stipulate that all people, no
matter what they have died from, should be treated in the same
279
manner. These precautions should be applied also to people
who have died of AIDS. People preparing the bodies should
be instructed to put on gloves and follow the hand washing
procedure. Bleach powder should be used if the body is oozing
fluids; the bleach will immediately kill the virus. However, it
is not necessary to cover the body with plastic. Disposal and
care of linen, instruments, and other materials should follow
the same procedure of disinfection, sterilization and disposal
as discussed in Chapter 4.

Chapter 15: Nutrition in HIV and
AIDS
The following symptoms and illnesses commonly caused by HIV
infection, that can either be caused by the disease itself or the side
effects of some of the medications, can lead to malnutrition:
· Anorexia
· Diarrhoea, fever
· Nausea and frequent vomiting
· Thrush
· Anemia
Nutrition Requirements and HIV Disease
Progression
Good nutrition helps persons with HIV and those who are suf -
fering from AIDS to fight infection, strengthen their immune
system, and manage HIV-related complications. The specific
benefits of good nutrition in developing resistance to infection
are illustrated in the figure below.
Figure 15.1 The cycle of good nutrition and resistance to infection
in the context of HIV and AIDS
284 Chapter 15: Nutrition in HIV and AIDS
Nutrition, Care and Support Priorities by Stage
Nutrition requirements vary according to underlying nutritional
status and HIV disease progression (early stage, middle stage
and last stage) as shown in the table below.
Table 15.1 Nutrition requirements and HIV disease progression
HIV stage Features Nutritional advice
Early stage · No symptoms
· Stable weight loss
· Counsel to stay healthy
Middle stage · Weight loss
· Opportunistic infections
associated effects
· Counsel to minimise consequences
· Counsel to maintain dietary intake
during acute illness
· Advise increased nutrient intake to
recover and gain weight
· Encourage continued physical
activity
Late stage · Symptomatic AIDS · Advise on treating opportunistic
infections
· Counsel to modify diet according to
symptoms
· Encourage eating and physical
activity
Nutrient Requirements for People Living with HIV
and AIDS
Energy requirements: HIV-infected persons have additional
energy needs because of:
· Energy used for HIV infection and opportunistic infections
· Nutrient malabsorption
· Altered metabolism
Protein requirements: HIV-infected persons do not require
more protein than the level recommended for healthy non-
285
HIV infected persons of the same age, sex and physical activity
level.
Micronutrient requirements: The role of micronutrients in
immune function and infectious diseases is well established and
it is important to ensure micronutrient intake at recommended
daily allowance (RDA) levels. HIV infected individuals are
encouraged to achieve this by consuming a variety of foods to
prevent deficiency. There is evidence that some micronutrient
supplements such as vitamin A, zinc and iron at higher doses
may produce adverse outcomes in HIV-infected persons (see also
Annex 7, The Role and Sources of Selected Micronutrients).
Good Dietary Practices
A Balanced Meal
Since there is no single food that contains all the nutrients that the
body needs, except breast milk for infants up to six months of age,
a recommended balanced meal for an HIV infected patient should
contain at least one food from each of the following food groups.
· Cereals, roots and tubers: should include maize, millet, rice,
sorghum, cassava, yams, potatoes and bananas.
· Pulses, nuts and foods of animal origin: should include
groundnuts, cashew nuts, beans, peas, meat, fish, milk, eggs
and edible insects such as caterpillars of those that are locally
known as senene and kumbikumbi.
· Fruits: should include all types of fruits such as mangoes,
oranges, guava, tangerines, bananas, baobab fruits (ubuyu)
and tamarind (ukwaju).
· Vegetables: all types including exotic and indigenous veg -
etables such as sweet potato leaves, pumpkin leaves, tomatoes,
amaranth, okra, carrots, pumpkins and other locally available
286 Chapter 15: Nutrition in HIV and AIDS
ones such as mlenda, figiri and mnavu.
· Sugar and fats: These are needed in moderation and should
include ghee, lard, butter, margarine, coconut oil, oil seeds
such as sunflower and groundnuts and sugars like honey.
· Water: It is recommended that an HIV-infected person
should drink at least eight glasses (1.5 to 2 litres) a day.
Nutrient requirements for HIV positive individuals
(WHO 2003)
· Energy: is increased by 10% asymptomatic stage and 20-
30% during symptomatic HIV
· Protein: No evidence of additional need
· Multiple Micronutrient Supplements
­ Best achieved through adequate diet.Where intakes
cannot be achieved, micronutrient supplements may be
needed (at RDA levels)
­ There is evidence that some micronutrient high dose
supplements eg.Vit.A, Zinc and Iron can produce adverse
outcomes in PLHA
­ Iron-folate supplementation for pregnant and lactating
women:There is no change on the usual recommendation
(499 ug folate and go mg iron daily for prevention and
twice per day for treatment
­ The usual additional nutritional requirements for pregnant
and lactating women apply
Tips for Healthy and Nutritious Lifestyles for PLHAs
It is recommended that PLHAs should:
· Eat a variety of foods
· Eat small meals frequently (especially for a very sick person)
· Be physically active, avoid alcohol and avoid smoking
287
· Add nutrient-dense foods (nuts, oil, fat, milk, oil seeds)
· Use spices for appetite and absorption: ginger, garlic, car -
damom, lemon
· Observe food safety, improve cooking methods and hygiene
principles
Note: Germination and sprouting; fermentation (increases
nutrient content and improves digestions and absorption.
Further information on role and source of selected micronutrients
for maintaining a healthy body is presented in Annex 6.
Dietary Practices and Nutrition for
AIDS Related Symptoms
Dietary management of AIDS-related symptoms refers to the
strategy of using food and dietary practices to alleviate the ef -
fects of AIDS-related symptoms on food intake and nutrient
absorption. It is therefore important to
· Ensure adequate food intake by adding more flavour, en -
couraging PLHAs to take small but frequent quantities of
meals and by presenting foods with a texture that can be
easily eaten by a PLHA. This means:
· Eliminatingfoodsandpracticesthatworseninfection,suchas
· Raw eggs and unpasteurised dairy products
· Foods not thoroughly cooked, and
· Unboiled water or juices made from unboiled water
· Avoiding foods that may affect food intake, such as
· Alcohol and coffee
· "Junk" foods with little nutritional value, and
· Foods that worsen symptoms related to diarrhoea,
nausea and vomiting, bloating, loss of appetite and
mouth sores (e.g., expired and fatty foods)
288 Chapter 15: Nutrition in HIV and AIDS
Nutritional Issues Associated with ARVs and
Other Modern Medicines
People infected with HIV may take various modern medications
including antibiotics to treat opportunistic infections, ARVs to
treat HIV and AIDS, anti-malarial medicines to treat malaria,
anti-helminthes, and anti-fungal medications.
Some side effects of these medications can be similar to certain
AIDS-related symptoms and call for similar dietary management.
Proper dietary management can help to manage some of these side
effects. The table below shows some simple nutritional actions
that can be taken to combat some of the side effects of ARVs.
Table 15.2: Simple nutritional actions to combat side
effects of ARVs
Side effect What a person can do
Nausea Eat small meals and drink plenty of fluids to help food go
down.
Diarrhoea Drink plenty of fluids, and use anti-diarrhoeals when
necessary.
Bad taste Try other foods. Avoid bad tasting foods.
Dry mouth Prefer meals which are liquid in consistency such as soups
that are also easier to swallow. Chew gum as this can
increase the amount of saliva in the mouth.
Sore mouth or
difficulty chewing
Prefer meals that are of liquid nature as they are easier to
swallow.
Nutritional Advice in Relation to Multiple
Medications
Treatment of AIDS may require taking many pills on a daily
basis, which can make it difficult to maintain adequate food
intake. On the other hand, if medications make it difficult for
a patient to eat, strict adherence to drug regimens is less likely.
289
This can create drug resistance especially in the case of ARVs.
It is therefore important that health workers emphasize the
importance of eating a variety of foods, while at the same time
adhering to the drug regimen.
Multiple medications may also have multiple food-drug in -
teractions and side effects. This may necessitate the setting of
specific timings for eating, identifying specific foods and/or
avoiding certain foods for each drug. Health workers need to
spend enough time with PLHAs, to list all the drugs taken and
counsel on the dietary management of the possible side effects
and interactions with food.
The following table lists the commonly used ARVs in Tanzania
as they relate to the need for dietary modification as well as their
side effects where necessary.

292 Chapter 15: Nutrition in HIV and AIDS
Nutrition and Antiretroviral Therapy
The following are guidelines for health workers that can help pro -
mote effective nutrition and medication management for ART.
· Counsel on the effects of food on the efficacy of medication,
on nutrient absorption and metabolism, and the side effects
of the medications.
· Counsel on the timing for taking medications and food/meals.
Explain the necessity of accurate timing for meals and drugs.
InvolvePLHAsandfamilymembersinconstructingamealand
drug-taking timetable and in selecting foods that can address
the negative effects of medications and food interactions.
· Assess any difficulties that PLHAs may be having in fol -
lowing the planned diet and timetable due to food access or
availability, taste or other reasons, and whether there have
been positive or negative changes in symptoms, side effects,
or drug adherence. Consult with PLHAs and suggest other
options when recommended foods are not available.
Assessment of Nutritional Needs in Relation to ARVs
Assessment helps to identify the most effective communication
channels for disseminating updated recommendations on dietary
management of food and medication interactions to program
planners, health workers, caregivers, and PLHAs. Below are a
series of questions that can guide health workers in carrying
out an assessment:
· What ARVs and other medications are used?
· What are the specific ARVs and medication-food interactions
in the local context?
· What are the common side effects of these ARVs and medica -
tions? What known foods aggravate or alleviate the symp -
293
toms? What are the dietary responses?
· What medications, including modern and traditional, are
taken for the treatment of opportunistic infections and the
diseases common to the area? What are their drug-drug
interactions? What are the drug-food interactions?
· What are the nutritional implications and the food recom -
mendations to manage the side effects (e.g., nausea, loss of
taste, poor nutrient absorption)? What is the effect of the
medication on nutrients?
AIDS-wasting Syndrome
AIDS-wasting syndrome is defined as a 10 percent weight loss
of baseline body weight together with either chronic diarrhoea
or weakness and fever for one month or more in the absence of
a concurrent illness other than HIV infection.
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Wasting is characterized by a loss of lean tissues. Lean tissues
in the body are responsible for most of the body's metabolic
functions including processing medications. The body starts to
lose its major functions as damage to the immune system and
weight loss progress. One can monitor weight loss in adults
by using body mass index (BMI) calculated as = Weight (Kg)
divided by height (m2). A normal BMI is 18.5 ­ 24.9 kg/m2. A
BMI <18.5 denotes underweight; that between 25.0 and 29.9
kg/m2 is overweight, and > 30.0 kg/m2 is obesity. For patients
with BMI <18.5 nutritional education is required and food
supplementation to be recommended.
It should be noted though that even without using BMI, un -
intended weight loss of between 6-7 kg in one month is not a
good sign. Therefore the weight of PLHAs needs to be closely
294 Chapter 15: Nutrition in HIV and AIDS
monitored to ensure they don't lose a lot of weight due to disease
progression and that appropriate nutritional intervention is
made and in a timely manner.
