FOREWORD
For more than three decades, Tanzania has made concerted response to the HIV and AIDS epidemic,
which nevertheless continues to claim the lives of thousands of her people, and threaten national, social,
and economic development. We are confronted with a generalized epidemic, with HIV prevalence
averaging at 5.3% on the Mainland, but with noticeable variations between regions. The devastating
impact of the epidemic is felt in all sectors and causes widespread suffering among individuals, families
and communities across the country. Due to HIV and AIDS, Tanzania has a significant number of orphans
who require support. The epidemic has also exacerbated the burden of poverty in our country.
During the period from 2001 to 2012, the annual budget for the Multi-sectoral response to the epidemic
increased from 17 billion to over 500 billion Shillings, comprising of both donor and domestic funds. There
are signs of hope as prevalence appears to be stabilizing, with expectations that this trend will continue
in the coming years. However, there are regions where HIV prevalence seems to be increasing. Overall,
it is inspiring that our multi-sectoral efforts to control the epidemic are succeeding, creating the possibility
of an AIDS-free generation. Improved access to care and treatment has brought much relief and hope to
thousands of People Living with HIV (PLHIV). The government will continue with HIV prevention efforts,
expanding HIV care and treatment, and consolidating HIV programmes with other services for easy access.
The launch of a voluntary HIV testing campaign by the President of the United Republic of Tanzania,
His Excellency Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete in July, 2007
, calling out to all adults to ascertain their HIV
status, was testimony of government's commitment to contain the epidemic. This commitment must be
sustained and enhanced throughout the implementation of NMSF III to achieve the goals of Zero New HIV
Infections, Zero AIDS-related Deaths, and Zero Stigma and Discrimination. In order to sustain the financial
resources required to achieve the overarching results, the Government of Tanzania is also in the process
of exploring feasible financing mechanisms that will support the country's long-term response to the HIV
and AIDS epidemic.
An AIDS-free Generation is feasible through a comprehensive HIV program which includes prevention,
care, treatment, program strengthening, and effective policies. It is the responsibility of every one of us,
individually and collectively, to prevent new HIV infections. We therefore appeal to the country as whole
to ensure that the next generation is free from HIV, through prevention measures, regular testing and
treatment in the case of infection to eliminate mother to child transmission.
This Framework is a broad National Strategic Plan designed to guide the country's multi-sectoral response
to the epidemic. It calls for scaling up of the comprehensive, national response in prevention, care,
treatment, and impact mitigation, in a way that is responsive to issues of gender. It emphasizes the
prevention of new HIV infections, with a special focus on women, youth and key populations at higher risk
of HIV. It also focuses on the necessary quality in the continuum of care for PLHIV and stewardship for
the nation's most vulnerable children. All sectors -public, private, faith-based organizations, civil society
organizations, and community based organizations are urged to prepare their own strategic plans with well-
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) xi
focused interventions that align to this Framework, paying attention to their comparative advantages
within their sectors. The government will continue to create an environment that is conducive
for all stakeholders to play their roles effectively in the control of the epidemic. We appeal to all
sectors, national and international partners to join hands with the government in implementing this
Framework so that we can significantly reduce the spread of HIV in our country by 2018.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The successful development of the Third National Multi-sectoral Strategic Framework (2013/14­2017/18)
involved a long consultative process with stakeholders. The successful completion of this document
was made possible by the joint efforts of organizations and individuals whose participation needs to be
acknowledged. First, thanks are due to the National Multi-sectoral Strategic Framework on HIV and AIDS
Steering Committee, and the Technical Working Groups in the five NMSF thematic areas.
We would like also to thank all Development Partners for their financial support and technical assistance,
national and international consultants, Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies, Regions and
Districts; representatives from Civil Society Organizations, formal and informal sectors, Faith-Based
Organizations and religious leaders for their valuable contributions towards completion of this document.
Overall coordination by the staff ofTACAIDS involving long working days was crucial to the success of this
process.
We are also grateful to all those who generously contributed their time to enable us gather crucial data for
our country's future planning. We acknowledge the support from all national leaders under the guidance
of His Excellency, Dr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete,The President of the United Republic ofTanzania, towards
the implementation of the NMSF II. It is our expectation that the same support will be provided for this
NMSF III.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Third National Multi-Sectoral Strategic Framework for Mainland Tanzania 2013/14-17/18 (NMSF III)
provides a common understanding for all HIV and AIDS stakeholders and reflects current normative
guidance in the national response effort. Development of the NMSF III has incorporated the evaluations
of the previous NMSF II (2008-2012) and recent epidemiological analyses of HIV inTanzania.The NMSF III
recognizes that while the national average adult HIV prevalence rate has declined over the last ten years,
HIV transmission rates among key populations, women, and in certain regions are not being adequately
controlled. Further, there has not been a significant decline in overall HIV prevalence over the periods
covered by the last twoTHMIS surveys. The comprehensive needs of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) are
often not being met; stigma and discrimination still prevail; and the coordination of the national response is
not resulting in all necessary services being available to those who need them. It is with this in mind that
the NMSF III aims towards the long term goals of elimination of new HIV infections, deaths from HIV, and
HIV-associated stigma and discrimination. Specifically, the NMSF III aims to achieve the following three
over arching results by 2018: a HIV incidence rate of no more than 0.16% (from a baseline of 0.32% in
2012), a significant reduction in AIDS-related deaths, and a reduced HIV related stigma and discrimination
among People Living with HIV and AIDS in the society.
These will be achieved through the following outcomes:
· Proportion of eligible PLHIV on care and treatment increased and sustained.
· Increased access and quality of HIV Testing and Counselling (HTC)
· Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission (eMTCT).
· Increased male and female condom use by men and women during risky sex.
· Elimination of blood borne transmission of HIV.
· Reduced risky behaviour of sexual intercourse among the general, infected, most-at-risk and
vulnerable populations.
· Increased prevalence of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC).
· Increased access to services and quality of treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
· Community Based Care and Support Interventions respond to HIV within their local context.
· HIV mainstreamed in sector-specific policies and strategies.
· Reduction of all HIV and AIDS related stigma and discrimination.
The NMSF III will achieve these outcomes through targeted priority investment in five strategic areas of
primary investment and six supporting areas of secondary investment, and employing five cross-cutting
programmatic principles.

The Strategic Areas of Primary Investment will include:
· Comprehensive Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)
· HIV Counselling and Testing ,
· Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission
· Comprehensive Sexuality, Gender, and Health Education and Services; and
· Condom Provision and Programming.
The supporting areas of secondary investment cover the following::
· Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC)
· Provision of Safe Blood
· Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
· Targeted Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) across the strategic programmes designed
to increase the demand for services, enhance knowledge, and lead to positive changes in risky
behaviours at personal, community and national level.
· Community Based Care and Support; and
· Mainstreaming of HIV and AIDS interventions.
Cross-Cutting Programmatic Principles
Five Cross-Cutting Programmatic Principles will be employed throughout the programme components of
NMSF III namely:
· Integration,
· Demand Creation,
· Human Rights,
· Gender and
· Programme Strengthening.
Achieving the NMSF III results towards the three zeros, strategic decisions will need to be made with
limited resources to ensure that the highest impact interventions and the most appropriate populations
based on epidemiology receive the greatest priority in investment. This will require communication
and coordination among all stakeholders to align priorities and strategies under a common framework
grounded in mutual accountability, gender, equality and human rights. Sustaining this effort will also
require investing in the skills, systems, and infrastructure sustaining the national response throughout the
period of the NMSF III and until Tanzania is able to realize an AIDS free generation. NMSF III also aims to
be responsive to new scientific data and evolving international guidelines. For example, WHO is expected
to update its consolidated HIV guidelines (The Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treating and Preventing
HIV Infection) every two years; NMSFIII will be reviewed at the mid-term and any changes may then be
adapted as necessary, based on new data and international guidelines.

1 Introduction, Context, and Principles of the NMSF III
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The Third National Multi-sectoral Strategic Framework (NMSF III) for HIV and AIDS in Tanzania provides a
common understanding for all HIV and AIDS stakeholders: government, civil society, the private sector,
and development partners to work together towards achieving the expected results. The NMSF III is not
intended to replace or duplicate other sectoral HIV and AIDS strategies. Rather, the NMSF III provides
the context within which other sectoral strategic plans and budgets should be formulated, monitored, and
coordinated.
Multi-sectoral development planning in Tanzania includes targets related to HIV incidence, prevalence,
HIV care and treatment services, and HIV stigma and discrimination in the current medium and long term
plans. The Tanzania Five Year Development Plan includes a target to "increase and strengthen services
for care and treatment of people living with HIV and AIDS to reach 800,000 by 2015/16 (Tanzania FiveYear
Development Plan,2011).
" In the Tanzania Long-Term Perspective Plan (LTPP) 2011/2012-25/26, the HIV
objectives for the health sector include reaching a "national prevalence rate of about 1.5 percent" as well
as "having a society in which our children can grow up free from the threat of HIV and AIDS and which
cares for and supports all those who are still infected and affected by HIV and AIDS (LTPP 2012)"
. The
NMSF III also sets ambitious targets for the elimination of new HIV infections, HIV-related deaths, and HIV
stigma and discrimination in order to improve the quality of life for allTanzanians.The static HIV prevalence
target has been replaced by a dynamic target ratio, relating incidence to treatment coverage Treatment
targets have been elaborated through the adoption of improved guidelines and programmes; and stigma
and discrimination targets set on the basis of routine nationally representative studies.
1.2 NATIONAL VISION, MISSION AND GOAL
The National HIV and AIDS Policy has adopted the following vision, mission and goal for the HIV national
response.
1.2.1 Vision
An HIV-free society where new infections are halted and people living with HIV and those
affected by HIV and AIDS receive quality services.
1.2.2 Mission
To guide the intensification and scaling up of quality HIV and AIDS prevention, care, treatment
and support services and impact mitigation interventions that are evidence-informed and locally
appropriate through multi-sectoral collaboration.
1.2.3 Goal
To ensure that the acquisition of new infections is significantly minimized, those who are living
with HIV have access to high quality, stigma-free services, and the negative personal and societal
impacts of HIV and AIDS are mitigated.

1.3 REGIONAL AND GLOBAL COMMITMENTS
The Government of Tanzania is a signatory to regional and global commitments regarding HIV and AIDS,
health and development.
1.3.1 Regional Commitments
· In the 2001 Abuja Declaration, Tanzania committed to allocating at least 15% of the national
budget (or 0.7% GNP) to improve the health sector (The Abuja Declaration and the Plan of
Action, 2003).
· The Tunis Declaration on Value for Money, Sustainability and Accountability in Health aimed to
increase domestic funding through cooperation between Ministries of Health, Ministries of
Finance, technical and financial partners (Tunis Declaration, 2012).
· MASERU Declaration on the fight against HIV and AIDS in the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) Region of 4th July 2003 recognizes the need for regional effort to fight HIV
and AIDS using multi-sectoral approach.
· The African Union Roadmap on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, TB and
Malaria in Africa establishes the commitment of African leaders to strengthening country
ownership to secure health security by investing national resources in order to reduce
dependence on external financing (African Union Roadmap, 2012).
The country is not yet on track in making substantial domestic contributions to reduce dependence
on external funding. Government's contribution to the HIV and AIDS response declined by 50%
from 22 Billion Tshs (PER 2006/7) to 11 Billion Tshs (PER 2011/12).
1.3.2 Global Commitments
International agreements, declarations, treaties and conventions on HIV and AIDS to which the
Government of Tanzania is signatory include:
· The UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
· The United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS (UNGASS), and
· The Political Declaration on HIV AIDS of June, 2011, which identified 10 global targets to achieve
by 2015.
The Millennium Development Goal commitments, to which the Government of Tanzania is a party,
ends in 2015. The available statistics indicate that the country is on track towards achieving MDG
4 and 6 related to Child and Infant mortality and combating HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases
by 2015. However challenges remain in achieving MDG 5 of reducing Maternal Mortality by 75%
Other International agreements, declarations, treaties and conventions on HIV and AIDS include;-
· UNAIDS agenda for Accelerated Country Actions for Women, Girls and Gender Equality and HIV
(2010-2014) (Operational plan , 2010).
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 5
· Global Plan towards elimination of new HIV infections among children and keeping their mothers
alive (2011-2015).
· Global commitments made by development partners in support of HIV and AIDS need to be
honoured.
Translation of these regional and global commitments into domestic policies and resources as demonstrated
in political leadership and fiscal investments in the national response will ensure the achievement of
sustainable results. In effect, this will speed up the realization of results proposed in the NMSF III as
well as the national long and medium term development frameworks. This Strategic Framework will be
complemented by a costed two years action plan and other tools for its implementation and monitoring.
1.4 CONTEXT AND RATIONALE OFTHE NMSF III
The last ten years have witnessed significant progress in the delivery of efficacious HIV prevention, care,
treatment, and programme strengthening interventions, leading to the decline in new HIV infections in
much of Sub Saharan Africa. During the same period, treatment programmes were scaled up, saving
millions of lives. Consequently, HIV prevalence is stabilizing and life expectancy is increasing as many
people living with HIV (PLHIV) are kept alive through efficacious treatment. All this was made possible
by the establishment of innovative global health financing mechanisms like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GF), the United Nations Innovative Financing Mechanism (UNITAID), and the
United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Over this period, the face of the
epidemic changed from an emergency condition that required vertical approaches into a broader, long-
term response that focused on overall development.
However, since the advent of the global macro-economic crisis in 2008, funding for HIV and AIDS has
steadily declined and funding mechanisms have begun to change their approaches to adapt to the new
economic environment. The Global Fund cancelled its call for Round 11 proposals and initiated the New
Funding Model at the same time, global health and funding institutions reasserted performance-based
funding and value for money approaches, for investing the scarce resources on appropriately targeted,
evidence-informed, cost-effective interventions. The NMSF III has taken these changes into account with
the ambition of investing for results. The following approaches have been adopted under NMSF III:-
1. Evidence-informed planning using selected priority interventions with high impact and targeting
them to the locations and populations where they will make the most impact.
2. Focusing on results which contribute to the attainment of desired national outcomes and investing
in systems to monitor and evaluate achievements.
3. Assessing the efficacy and feasibility of interventions, focusing on the capacity and systems
required for cost-effective, programme implementation and evaluation.
4. Addressing the structural and behavioural aspects of the epidemic, situating evidenced-informed
interventions in their proper context, while addressing key populations.
5. Ensuring the sustainability of interventions, including financial, material and human resources,
community ownership, organizational development, services availability, coverage and
accountability.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
6
The above approaches link with other key national strategies including:
1. Tanzania Development Vision 2025, which identifies Tanzania's national aspirations.
2. The National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP) targeting the elimination of
HIV in Tanzania.
3. The Health Sector Strategic Plan III (2009-15) which focuses on achieving the Millennium
Development Goals, in which HIV is a cross-cutting target disease; and
4. HIV Health Sector Strategic Plan II (2013-17), designed to support universal access to preventative,
care, treatment and support services.
1.5 PRINCIPLES OFTHE NMSF III
1.1.1. Integration
The national response to HIV and AIDS extends beyond the scope of TACAIDS and NACP
,
encompassing other health sector programmes such as TB, nutrition, and reproductive and child
health services, as well as other social and economic sector responses, including anti-poverty
programmes. The NMSF III promotes fostering, fortifying, and reviewing sectoral contributions to
the National Response, documenting and evaluating all contributions as part of the mid-term and
end-term reviews. The NMSF III leverages the resources and structures existing among key state
and non-state actors to ensure a common agenda towards the global and national goals of zero
new HIV infections, zero AIDS-related deaths, and zero stigma and discrimination.
1.1.2. Demand Creation
Creating demand for HIV-associated services begins with quality improvement. With high-quality,
life-saving and life-enhancing services in place, accessibility becomes the next priority. Leveraging
the interventions of the Mpango wa Maendeleo ya Afya ya Msingi (MMAM), the Primary Health
Care Development Plan (2007-2017), itself designed to ensure the equitable access to integrated
HIV and public health services, the NMSF III also promotes efforts to strengthenTanzania's network
of health facilities, promoting client satisfaction and encouraging appropriate demand for facility
and community based services. Strong political and government commitment and leadership will
also be needed to increase demand among Tanzania's underserved and key populations at higher
risk for HIV. Active participation of community leadership, cultural and religious leadership, the
formal and informal segments of the private sector, and PLHIV leadership will also be needed
to supplement the efforts of the public sector. Demand for HIV-associated services will also be
enhanced through promotion of mutual accountability and responsibility, as a part of the collective
national response.
1.1.3. Human Rights
The NMSF III safeguards human rights through promoting the gender-HIV strategy by removal of
all barriers to HIV-associated services. This includes review and improvement of the legal, policy,
and social environment that encourages access for under-served and key populations. The human
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 7
rights of people living with HIV will also be protected through their meaningful engagement in
implementing the NMSF III, including their active leadership and feedback in an environment free
of stigma and discrimination.
1.1.4. Gender
Recognizing the existing structural inequalities that exist because of gender discrimination and
gender-based violence, the NMSF III promotes comprehensive sexuality and gender education
at all levels to supplement the biomedical HIV curricula in use. This includes alignment with the
"Medical Management Guidelines of Gender ­ Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Child Abuse.
"
However, recognizing that a small percentage of women and girls currently access formal GBV
services, the NMSF III promotes a broader, multi-sector response to the widespread ignorance
around issues of sexuality and gender that lead to stigma, discrimination and violence.

2. Country Context and Situational Analysis
2.1 Geographic and Demographic Characteristics
The United Republic of Tanzania covers approximately 945,300 square kilometres and sharing
borders with eight (8) countries. For administrative purposes, Mainland Tanzania is divided into
25 regions, which are further subdivided into 156 district, municipal and town councils. According
to 2012 population census, the population of Mainland Tanzania is approximately 43.6 million
people and it has been growing at an annual rate of 2.7%. Nearly half of the population (48%)
is below 15 years of age; 49% are aged 15-64 years and 4% are over 65 years. Furthermore
statistics indicate that 73% of population live in rural areas and 27% live in urban areas. The
sex ratio stands at 95 males per 100 females. The life expectancy at birth is 56 years for females
and 53 years for males .Infant mortality has dropped from 58 per 1,000 live births in 2007/08 to
51 per 1,000 live births in 2009/10, while under-5 mortality has declined from 91 per 1 000 live
births to 81 per 1 000 live births during the same period. Underlying these successes has been
the continued implementation of the Reproductive and Child Health Strategic Plan, the Strategic
Plan to Accelerate the Reduction of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Deaths, and the Expanded
Programme for Immunization (EPI). Progress achieved through these strategic interventions in
maternal health has provided a platform for further integration and strengthening of programmes
in HIV prevention, including PMTCT, counselling and testing, bio-medical interventions in care and
treatment, and community service delivery.
2.1.1 Economic Characteristics
Tanzania is among the poorest countries in the world with a per capita Gross National Income
of US $ 550. Tanzania is ranked at position 152 out of 187 countries on the Human Development
Index (UNDP 2011). The economy depends heavily on agriculture, which accounts for more
than one-quarter of GDP
, provides 85% of exports, and employs about 80% of the work force.
The population is concentrated in the Lake Zone along Lake Victoria in the north, around Dar es
Salaam, the main business and trading centres along the coast, and in the southern highlands
around Mbeya. Large areas of the country are sparsely populated.
Macro-economic performance in Tanzania has been resilient to shocks with an estimated real
GDP growth of 6.4% in 2012. Furthermore, GDP is projected to remain buoyant, increasing to
6.9% in 2013 and projected to 7% in 2014, creating opportunities for financing key social sectors,
such as health, including HIV, TB, and malaria programmes (Tanzania Country Notes, 2013). The
economy is largely based on service provision, agriculture, industry, mining and construction.
Despite the impressive GDP growth, poverty remains persistent and has been at the centre
of the development debate. It was against this background that the new national development
agenda, MKUKUTA II, was designed with a greater focus on making growth more broad based
and pro-poor.
CHAPTERTWO
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 9
Key goals under the strategy include:
· Reducing poverty by promoting inclusive, sustainable and employment-enhancing growth.
· Creation and sustenance of productive and decent employment, especially for women, youth
and people with disabilities.
· Food and nutrition security through increased agricultural productivity.
Specifically for the national response to HIV and AIDS, MKUKUTA II set the following operational
targets:
· HIV infection rate reduced.
· National HIV prevalence in 15-24 years age group reduced from 2.4% in 2010 to 1.2% by 2015.
· Access to ARV and food supplement for PLHAs increased; and
· Number of orphaned and vulnerable children aged 0-17 whose households receive external
support increased from 586,170 in 2009 to 1,318,187 by 2015.
Under the food and nutrition security anti-poverty strategy, the government rolled out the "Kilimo
Kwanza" or"Agriculture First" initiative, designed to reduce poverty through increased productivity
in agriculture, which has been an integral part of the overall development strategy. This strategy
targets poverty reduction from the 2012/2013 level of 34% to 24% by 2015 ­ still higher than
the MDG target of 19.3%. Priorities include clean water provision and irrigation, financial and
insurance services, value addition, trade and exports development. Unemployment also remains
a concern with nearly 2.4 million people unemployed as of 2011. Most of the unemployed are
young and urban-based, representing 10.7% of the population. A lack of sufficient employment
opportunities for young women, in particular, exposes them to risky behaviour with incumbent
dangers of HIV infection.
Recognizing the challenges posed by Tanzania's economic climate, and the social and economic
vulnerability of a significant part of the national population, the NMSF III will promote synergy
with the National Social Protection Framework (2011), which provides guidelines for improved
co-ordination, implementation and enforcement of social protection interventions that ensure
livelihoods for the poorest and most vulnerable groups. The national response to HIV and AIDS
should therefore also promote scaling up social protection interventions such as pensions
(including income transfers) and insurance schemes, as well as strengthening and implementing
laws related to social protection.
2.1.2 Social and Cultural Characteristics
2.1.2.1 The Situation of Women and Children
Existing gender imbalances have hindered women's meaningful participation and decision-
making in development programmes. Regardless of their socio-economic or educational status,
approximately 40% of women do not have the final say in decisions regarding their own health,
their children's health or their own daily household expenditure. Women's access to mass media
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
10
is significantly lower than that of men, and this, compounded by lower literacy and more limited
education, undermines the contribution that women are able to make towards social and economic
development. Female household populations still have high numbers with no formal education,
11.5% in urban areas and 30.2% in rural areas (2013, p. 27). Yet, women remain the primary labour
force for household food production in the nation.
According to a 2007 study, approximately one million children in Tanzania had been orphaned,
12% of the vulnerable children had been separated from their siblings, and up to 240,000 children
below the age of 15 were living with HIV and AIDS (Social Protection in Tanzania, 2007). More
recently, orphaned children were estimated at 11.2% in urban areas and 9.2% in rural areas in
Mainland Tanzania. Regarding food scarcity, 9% of urban and 17% of rural households reported
often having problems satisfying their food needs Access to improved sources of drinking water
is also unavailable for more than 11.4% of urban dwellers and 53.2% of rural dwellers. While
almost all youths aged 15-24 years have heard about HIV and AIDS, less than half have enough
knowledge to protect themselves against infection.
2.1.2.2 Gender Based Violence (GBV)
Gender inequality and gender based violence have been cited in various reports to contribute
to HIV infection. Unequal power relations between men and women limits decision making for
women and girls in negotiating for safe sex and condom use, and increases the extent of violation
of women's' and girls' rights. The most common forms of GBV are physical, sexual, psychological,
and economic, including financial deprivation and exploitation. The Tanzania Demographic and
Health Survey (2010) reveals that 39% of women in the age 15-49 years have experienced physical
violence at least once in their lives, with 33% of such violence occurring within the 12 months
preceding the survey. There are notable zonal variations in GBV ranging from 61% of women in
the Central zone to 22% in the Northern zone having experienced GBV, irrespective of woman's
education or economic status (Ibid., p.270). Overall 10% of women in the age 15-49 years had a
forced first sexual intercourse (Ibid., p.271).
Results from the National Survey on "Violence against Children" in 2012 by UNICEF in Tanzania
show that girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence. Nearly one out of three females
and one out of seven males have experienced some form of sexual violence prior to the age of
eighteen. Few children disclose, fewer children seek services, and even fewer receive them when
they are brave enough to report. Overall, the National Survey showed that about 48% of girls and
68% of boys had never disclosed the sexual violence that they had experienced in childhood prior
to the survey. Only about 20% of girls and 10% of boys who had experienced sexual violence
sought services after the experience, but not all respondents who sought services received them.
Approximately 13.0% of females and 3.7% of males who experienced sexual violence reported
that they actually received services after seeking them. Girls who received services said they
received counselling, clinic, or hospital services, or help from an elder or community leader.
Tanzanian children experiencing sexual abuse and violence are more likely to be exposed to sexual
exploitation, including transactional sex, less likely to have a HIV test or use condoms, and more
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 11
likely to have multiple sexual partners as they grow older (Violence Against Children Report, 2011).
The result from "Child Sex Abuse "in 2012 revealed that young children are not safe. The problem
of child and sexual abuse in the society is growing. The need for concerted public education on
the nature of this violence and its consequences is imperative.
2.1.2.3 RiskyTraditional Practices
Although Tanzania has positive traditional practices which help to mitigate the impact of HIV and
AIDS, such as strong extended family support structures and social sanctions, there are also some
risky traditional practices that hinder the effectiveness of the national response. These include wife
inheritance by a male relative of the deceased husband, female genital mutilation, early or child
marriages, and limited property rights for widows. HIV Prevalence among widows aged 15 and 49
years is estimated at 24.7%. A comparison of TDHS 2004 data and that of the TDHS 2010 shows
that the proportion of married young women aged 15-19 years fell by 20% while, pregnancy and
childbirth among young women of this age dropped by more than 12%. Nevertheless, despite the
gains, one in six young women aged 15-19 is married. In addition, young women and girls face a
significantly higher risk of death from pregnancy and delivery-related complications, which is further
compounded by the high frequency of births which occur at home without skilled attendants.
2.1.2.4 Policy and Legal Environment
Tanzania developed its first National Policy for HIV and AIDS in 2001, subsequently implemented
through two strategic frameworks which were completed in 2012. In 2008, Tanzania enacted
the HIV Prevention and Control Act (HAPCA). Part VIII of the Act provides for PLHIV rights and
obligations. Section 33(1) (a) and (b) provide for rights to access quality medical services and
treatment for opportunistic diseases. Section 33(2) (a) and (b) provide for obligation of protection
to others from re-introducing infections into the population. According to Section 28-32 of this law,
discrimination is a punishable offence. In 2010, regulations for HIV Counselling andTesting, use of
ARVs, and disclosure were developed and gazetted. The regulations provide for protection against
forced testing and mandatory disclosure.
The National HIV and AIDS Policy (2012) further emphasize the importance of respect for the human
rights of PLHIV, as stipulated in the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. Specifically
the policy commits to enhancing measures that ensure all civil, legal and human rights for men,
women, boys and girls living with HIV and AIDS, in accordance with the URT Constitution and
other International Conventions. Against a backdrop of protective policies and laws, the Law of
Marriage Act (1971), which provides for early marriage (15 years for females by statute, or 14 years
with consideration of "special circumstances") thus increasing the risk of HIV infection to young
women and girls, and other similar laws need to be revised.
Other opportunities for reform and improvement under the current policy and legal framework also
deserve consideration. For example, the shortages in human resources for the national response
to HIV and AIDS, together with the need to scale up service provision, require examination of the
policies surrounding task sharing for interventions such as HIV testing, PMTCT, and HIV treatment.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
12
As described in "Analysis of Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Frameworks forTask Shifting inTanzania,
"
the Minister of Health and Social Welfare has the power to permit other health professionals,
broadly defined, to dispense prescription drugs such as ARVs and to expand the prescribed tasks
that can be performed by nurses and other clinical staff, such as initiating or managing ART (Health
Policy Initiative, Tanzania, 2013). Task sharing also involves increased community mobilization for
the benefit of all sectors in the national response to HIV and AIDS.
2.2 THE HEALTH SYSTEM INTANZANIA MAINLAND
The health system in MainlandTanzania operates with technical coordination and in-service training
of health care workers from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW); administration
and supervision of facilities by the Prime Minister's Office ­ Regional and Local Government
(PMO-RALG); and using human resources provided with pre-service training under the authority
of the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT). In addition, the health system is
facilitated by ministries, departments and agencies which provide different services that support
health, ranging from actors in the legal framework that support justice and gender rights to those
responsible for agricultural improvements and increased access to water. There are many actors
that play a role in the health system. The public health sector is also augmented by services from
non-state actors including faith-based organizations (FBOs), Community Service Organizations
(CSOs), and other private sector actors, both formal and informal.
The health sector has been implementing the Health Sector Strategic Plan III (2009-2015), which is
currently under review in preparation for HSSP IV. Under HSSP III, eleven strategies are enumerated
in conjunction with two major programmes, the Primary Health Services Development Programme
(PHSDP or MMAM) previously mentioned and the Human Resources for Health Strategic Plan.
These programmes are designed to scale up health facility service coverage and human resources
for health respectively, which support the overall health sector response to HIV and AIDS.
2.2.1 Human Resources for Health (HRH)
Human resources for health in Tanzania are produced by 135 pre-service institutions, including
62 government, 47 FBO, 5 private and 10 university programmes (2012, p. 32). From the 2006
­ 2011, the total number of health care workers has increased from 47
,000 to 56,000. However,
much work remains to be done (Ibid., p.24). The current Human Resource for Health Strategic
Plan (2008-13) has been focusing on strategies for improved training, recruitment, and retention of
health care workers (2008, p. 23).
2.2.2 Health Facilities
The health system has a total of 6,342 health facilities which include facilities owned by private,
faith-based organizations and Parastatal institutions. In terms of distance to a health facility, 96%
of urban households and 70% of rural households in Mainland Tanzania live within 5 kilometres of
a health facility (2013, p. 18). In addition, only 55% of health workers are serving a rural population,
which represents 75% of the total population. Moreover, there are fewer specialized cadres of
health care workers available in the rural areas (2012, p. 30). As of December 2012, there were
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 13
4,914 health facilities providing PMTCT services, of which 1,404 provided full ART services. To
reach the NMSF III treatment targets, in line with PMTCT Option B+, all facilities providing PMTCT
will need to be upgraded to provide ART.
2.2.3 The Health Sector Response to HIV and AIDS
The MoHSW provides HIV health services through the coordination of the National AIDS Control
Programme (NACP) as well as TB, nutrition, and reproductive and child health services. These
services include surveillance of HIV infections and other STIs, HIV care and treatment, Prevention
of Mother to Child Transmission, HIV Counselling and Testing, home based care, and monitoring
and reporting of the health sector response to HIV and AIDS. NACP's strategic role in the national
response to HIV and AIDS is further detailed in the Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan
(HSHSP
, 2013-2017), a subset of both the Health Sector Strategic Plan III and the National Multi-
sector Strategic Plan III.
From the 6,342 health facilities mentioned above, a total of 1,078,018 PLHIV were enrolled in care
and treatment clinics all over the country and 660,723 PLHIV initiated on ART as of December
2012.
The NMSF III will leverage the health sector's comparative strength by working closely with the
MoHSW and other key departments to deepen the implementation of the Primary Health Services
Development Plan 2007-2017 (PHSDP).
However, there are challenges facing the health sector response to HIV and AIDS. These include
coping with the rapidly expanding programmes, inadequate and unpredictable financing, weak
procurement and supply chain management, shortage of skilled human resources for health, and
poor infrastructure to provide HIV and AIDS services, resulting in inadequate coverage of services.
These challenges are being addressed in the on-going implementation of the PHSDP
. MOHSW
is also implementing the Human Resources Strategic Plan 2008/2013 (HRHSP) that guides the
health sector in proper planning, development, management and effective utilization of human
resources (2008, p. 1). However, according to the Public Expenditure Review of Human Resources
for Health, it is unlikely that the health sector will achieve its target of having a work force of
214,753 in public and private sectors by 2017
, due to the limited capacity of the training institutions
in the country (PER - HRH, 2011). Collaboration and partnership between the public and private
sectors should therefore be strengthened to achieve the best results.

3 Overview of HIV and AIDS in Tanzania
3.1 HIV Prevalence on the General Population
Since the first three AIDS cases were reported in Tanzania in 1983, infections have spread rapidly,
leadingtoageneralizedepidemic,withpocketsofaconcentratedepidemic,andadevastatingimpact
on social and economic development. The predominant mode of HIV transmission is heterosexual
contact between HIV-infected and uninfected individuals, with sexual transmission accounting for
approximately 80% of infections. Vertical infections from mothers to newborns account for about
18% of infections and medical transmission through unsafe blood for approximately 1.8%. By the
end of 2012,Tanzania had an estimated 1.5 million people living with HIV and approximately 86,000
new HIV infections (Spectrum, 2013). This can be attributed in part to widespread risky behaviours,
inconsistent and incorrect condom use, inadequate numbers of eligible individuals on antiretroviral
therapy, increased gender-based vulnerability, and some risky, traditional cultural practices.
3.1.1 HIV Prevalence
Although HIV prevalence in Mainland Tanzania has declined from 7
.0% to 5.3% during the period
from 2003/04 to 2011/12 (2011-12) among all adults aged 15-49, and from 6.3% to 3.9% among
men in the same age group, there has not been a statistically significant decrease among women.
Regional variation throughout MainlandTanzania ranges from 1.5% in Manyara to 14.8% in Njombe.
3.1.2 HIV Prevalence by Age and Sex
There exist age and sex differentials in HIV prevalence in Tanzania as indicated in figure 2 below.
Among both men and women, HIV prevalence increases with age generally and women invariably
have higher prevalence rates in all age groups compared to men. However, prevalence among
young women aged 25 ­ 29 is 3 times higher compared to young men in the same age group.

3.1.3 HIV Prevalence by Marital Status
HIV prevalence is significantly associated with marital status and highest among those widowed
and divorced/separated. Prevalence is higher for women compared to men among the never
married and divorced/separated.

3.1.4 Trends in HIV Incidence and Prevalence
Data from four rounds of antenatal clinic attendees and two national population surveys and
projections indicate that HIV incidence and prevalence have declined and stabilized. The incidence
of HIV infection in the age group 15-49 years peaked at 1.34% in 1992, declined rapidly down to
0.64% in 2000, and steadily declined further to 0.32% in 2012. Similarly, HIV prevalence increased
to a peak of 8.4% in 1996, declined to 5.7% in 2008, and declined further to 5.3% by 2012.
However, a wide variation exists between regions and within regions across social and age groups
(THIS 2004, THMIS 2008 & 2012).

3.1.5 Trends of HIV Prevalence by Regions inTanzania
While there was an overall decline in HIV prevalence in Tanzania in the period 2008 and 2012,
the change was not statistically significant. There are 8 regions that witnessed an increase in
prevalence levels; these include Ruvuma, Rukwa, Kagera, Mtwara, Kilimanjaro, Kigoma, Singida
and Arusha. The increase in HIV prevalence in these regions could be a factor of successful care
and treatment programmes or an actual rise in HIV infection within the regions or both. Other
possible factors, such as HIV test refusal rates, should also be explored to explain the change in
prevalence over this short time period.

Figure 4: HIV Prevalence by Region between 2008 and 2012

Six regions in the Southern Highland Zone (Njombe, Iringa, Mbeya, Ruvuma, Rukwa and Katavi),
two regions in the Coastal (Pwani and Dar es Salaam) zone and one in the Lake zone (Shinyanga)
had HIV prevalence rates above the national average. These variations call for a strategic focus in
this NMSF III to control and scale down new HIV infections in regions with high prevalence and
understand and address the factors behind rising trends in prevalence in the regions.

3.1.6 HIV Prevalence in Urban and Rural Areas by Sex
Tanzania has marked rural-urban and sex differences in HIV Prevalence. For both males and females,
urban residents (7

3.1.7 HIV Prevalence among Key Population Groups
Tanzania follows the international standard definition of Key Populations, a term referring to
populations at high risk for exposure to HIV or for transmitting HIV (Terminology Guidelines,
2011). In the Tanzanian context, these key populations include all PLHIV, as well as serodiscordant
couples, sex workers and their clients, men who have sex with men, women who have anal
sex, and people who inject drugs. Other vulnerable groups who may also be among those at
higher risk for HIV exposure or transmission include women and girls, youth, people in conflict
and post-conflict situations, refugees and internally displaced persons, migrant labourers, and
people working in mining and fishing industry and their surrounding communities. Recent studies
conducted in various regions in Tanzania showed varying degrees of HIV prevalence among key
population groups, with the prevalence of MSM, FSW, and PWID all significantly above the national
average (Country Progress Reporting, Part A: Tanzania Mainland, 2012). This variation is alarming
and therefore calls for effective strategic HIV prevention interventions. In the Tanzanian context,
other population groups that deserve special consideration in HIV programming include prisoners,
long-distance track drivers, disabled (in all forms), fishing communities, and people in mining,
women and children.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 19
3.1.8 People Who Inject Drugs (PWID)
A small sample survey of 430 respondents undertaken in Temeke Municipality, Dar es Salaam
region revealed an HIV seroprevalence of 26% (34.8 % among IDUs and 11.7 % Non IDUs).
Among the newly diagnosed IDUs, women had higher HIV prevalence and there was also a high
proportion of Hepatitis C co-infection. Gender also played a significant role in the risk profile of
injecting and noninjecting drug using participants. Males and females did not report significantly
different injecting risk behaviours, but females were more likely to have sold sex and have a higher
number of sex partners thus increasing their vulnerability to HIV infection. Among People Who
Inject Drugs (PWID) with non-injecting partners, 89% of males and 75% of females reported
inconsistent condom use with their regular partner (Risk Practices among PWID inTemeke, 2011).
Stigma and discrimination against PWID remains high, posing a significant challenge to outreach
and delivery of friendly health services. This highlights the need to prioritize the recommended
package of comprehensive intervention for HIV prevention and care among PWID. Furthermore,
the importance of PWID not sharing needles should remain a key component of the comprehensive
harm reduction package inTanzania, together with education about the risks of sexual transmission
and the need for protection through consistent and correct use of condoms.
3.1.9 Sex Workers
A BROAD Definition of a sex worker includes anyone who exchanges sexual services for money or
goods, whether regularly as a full-time activity, temporarily as a short-term measure, or sporadically
as an occasional though longer-term activity. Sex workers include men and women, young and old.
Prevention, care, treatment, and support programmes for sex workers and their clients are being
implemented in Tanzania, but need significant expansion and support.
In a study conducted with 537 female sex workers in Dar es Salaam, one-third of respondents
were reported to be divorced or separated, while over half were never married. In the study, 69.7%
reported that sex work constituted their main source of income; 31.4% tested HIV sero-positive;
69.3% reported always using a condom with regular clients though only 31.6% reported always
using a condom with their steady partner in the previous 30 days. A high prevalence of sexual and
physical abuse (51.7%) was also reported in the previous 12 months (HIV BBSS Among Female
Sex Workers, DSM, 2012).
According to the Violence Against Children Survey (VAC) results, 4% of Tanzanian girls received
money or goods in exchange for sex at least once in their lifetime. Of the girls, 82% who reported
receiving money or goods for sex also reported childhood sexual violence; 90% who received
money or goods for sex reported childhood physical violence by a relative, and 50% who received
money or goods for sex reported childhood emotional violence (Violence Against Children Report,
2011). A study conducted in Mwanza region on cross-generational and transactional sexual relations
revealed that the main reason for having sexual relationship was to receive presents or money.
The study involved male and female respondents aged 12 years and above from primary 52%
and secondary schools 10% (Luke & Kurtz, 2002). Stigma and discrimination against sex workers
remains high, posing a significant challenge to outreach and delivery of friendly health services.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
20
Overall, these data call for an urgent need to address the different contexts in which sex work
occurs. The high HIV prevalence among sex workers requires addressing the factors that inhibit
condom use in both transactional and intimate partner contexts. In addition, the correlation of
childhood sexual violence and engaging in transactional sex emphasizes the need to educate,
empower, and equip girls and young women to avoid exposure to non-consensual, forced sex and
sexual violence.
3.1.10 Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM)
In a research study of 271 MSM with a mean age of 26 years, 41% were reported to have tested
HIV seropositive; 63.1% had also been married or cohabited with a woman at least once in their
life. Those reporting no condom use with their last casual sex partner was 43.2%, while 49.1%
used condoms with their last regular sex partner. About 30% of all respondents were reported
to be engaged in commercial sex work (Condom Use in MSM, 2013). Stigma and discrimination
against MSM remains high, posing a significant challenge to outreach and delivery of friendly
health services. Given the criminalization of consensual adult homosexual intercourse, the multi-
sectoral national response requires significant cooperation from all key stakeholders to ensure that
MSM are reached with HIV and AIDS services.
3.2 KEY FACTORS IN HIVTRANSMISSION
A number of key factors in HIV transmission have been identified, including individual behavioural,
socio-cultural and biomedical factors.These factors are important, as they become critical strategy
considerations in combating the epidemic. Addressing these issues effectively will contribute to
overall prevention goals.
3.2.1 Individual Behavioural Factors
Individual behavioural factors refer primarily to the inter-personal contexts in which sexual behaviour
and sexual HIV transmission occur.
3.2.1.1 Multiple Unprotected Sexual Relations
Multiple sexual relations in the form of concurrent or serial, extramarital, premarital, trans-
generational, transactional, casual or a combination of these are common in Tanzania. Sex with
more than one partner in the year prior to the survey was reported by 21% of men and 4% of
women (THMIS 2011/12). There is a direct relationship between HIV prevalence and the number
of lifetime sexual partners, rising from 2.9% among women with one life time partner to 18.9%
among those with 10 or more lifetime partners, and 0.9% to 7
.5% among men respectively (Ibid.,
p.115). Multiple concurrent partnerships (MCP) are driven by socio-cultural gender-based factors
including poverty, frequent travel, working away from home and peer pressure. The underpinning
transmission factor is unprotected sexual intercourse.
3.2.1.2 Inter or Cross-Generational Sexual Relations
Inter- or cross-generational sex, involving high-risk intercourse, between young women and older
men was estimated at 7
.6% among women aged 15-19 in mainland Tanzania in 2010. There was
a notable difference between urban and rural populations, with 10.4% of Mainland urban young
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 21
women at risk and 6.7% of Mainland rural young women. Urban Dar es Salaam, however, performed
better than the national trend with only 4.8% of young women reporting such high-risk behaviour
(TDHS, 2011). Anecdotal evidence indicates that male youth also practice sex with older women,
motivated by money, gifts or a social standing aspiration.
3.2.1.3 Early Sexual Debut
Early sexual debut and adolescent sexual networking without protection exposes young people,
especially girls, to HIV and STI infection. In Mainland Tanzania, 9.7% of young women and 10.2%
of young men aged 15-24 had sexual intercourse before age 15, while 51.6% of young women
and 43.9% of young men aged 18-24 had sexual intercourse before 18 (THMIS 2011-2012). Out of
those who have never married (15-24), only 57
.9% of women and 59% of men used condom during
their last sexual intercourse (Ibid. p.99).
3.2.1.4 Alcohol Abuse
Alcohol abuse is associated with the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections, including
HIV. In reviewing the literature on alcohol use and sexual risk in southern Africa, includingTanzania,
studies show consistent links between the quantities of alcohol that people drink and sexual risks
for contracting HIV. In addition, clear gender differences emerge in the various studies: men's
drinking is associated with increased risks; while women's risks are primarily associated with their
male partner's drinking. In one study of a mining community in Tanzania, testing HIV positive
was independently associated with greater alcohol use (HIV and STI prevalences in goldmine
communities, 2003). Others studies from Tanzania correlate increased sexual risk taking with
increased levels of drinking (Alcohol Use and Sexual Risks, 2007).
3.2.1.5 Infrequent and Inconsistent Use of Condoms
The dual protection provided by condoms is subject to their consistent and correct use. Infrequent
and inconsistent use of condoms often lower protection among individuals in long standing
relationships including married and cohabiting individuals. The challenge to condom usage in
Tanzania revolves around four critical factors:
1. Accessibility, including the potentially high cost of condoms, demand creation, unavailability
and stock outs, poor marketing and distribution outlets (distribution and cost), and gaps in
integrating condom usage in reproductive health programming.
2. Lack of correct knowledge of usage, efficacy, and stigma related to condom usage.
3. Attitudes including persistent risky behaviour choices and religious beliefs.
4. Inadequate capacity for women and girls to negotiate condom use due to traditional and cultural
factors which perpetuate gender inequality.
3.2.1.6 Unprotected Penetrative Heterosexual Anal Intercourse
Penile-anal intercourse is typically associated with male homosexual relationships, with relatively
little attention given to the issues related to anal intercourse in heterosexual relationships. Anal
intercourse is thought to be associated with considerable risk of HIV-1 transmission, studies,
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
22
however, have shown that women's risk of contracting HIV through heterosexual anal sex (HAS)
is also significantly higher than from vaginal intercourse. The pooled risk of male-to-female HIV-1
transmission for unprotected receptive anal sex is much higher ranging from 1.4% to 1.7% per
sex act, with no significant differences between per sex act risks of unprotected receptive anal
intercourse for heterosexual couples.
In 2012/2013 Mwanza Intervention Trial Unit (MITU) in collaboration with Ifakara Health Institute
and MUHAS carried out formative study to determine the dynamics of heterosexual anal sexual
intercourse in Mwanza, Tanga, Dar es Salaam, and Morogoro regions, and demonstrate that, the
practices do happen among couples in Tanzania. To understand the magnitude a follow up study
is required.
Comprehensive sexual education including targeted information about the risk of HIV transmission
through anal intercourse, together with increased access to condoms should be considered in
developing strategies to address these groups.
3..2.2 Socio-Cultural Factors
Socio-cultural factors refer to the broader population-level contexts in which HIV transmission
occur. These include factors such as stigma, discrimination, mobility, migration, gender based
violence, gender inequalities and wealth disparity.
3.2.2.1 Stigma and Discrimination against PLHIV
Stigma is highly prevalent in Tanzania at various levels and settings, as data from the 2012 Stigma
Index show. There is breaching of confidentiality through health delivery systems. While 15% of
the PLHIV felt that health care providers did not keep their information confidential, another 5.4%
had their serostatus disclosed without their consent. Further, the study revealed discrimination by
health care providers. For example, 13% of PLHIV were told not have children, 44% were denied
access to reproductive health information, 14% were coerced in accepting particular infant feeding
options, and about 9% were coerced in their use of family planning methods. Few (19%) eligible
pregnant women living with HIV received ART for PMTCT. Others were coerced into sterilization
and pregnancy termination by health service providers due to their HIV positive status (People
Living with HIV Stigma Index, 2012).
The study also reveals high levels of self-stigma. Most PLHIV reported a sense of shame (44%),
self-blame (63.4%), feelings of worthlessness (85%), feelings that PLHIV deserves to be punished
(10%), and self-isolation because of their HIV positive serostatus. Self-Stigma drives many PLHIV
who are sexually active not to bear children (38%) or get married (16%) because of their HIV
positive serostatus. PLHIV also remove themselves from places where they would be potentially
stigmatized, including work places, for fear of gossip (45%), being verbally insulted, harassed,
and threatened (30%). Furthermore, the study showed that fewer PLHIV know where to seek
assistance once their human rights are violated. A majority of PLHIV are not aware of their rights,
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 23
the national HIV and AIDS Policy, legal information, and global commitments on HIV and AIDS. In
addition, community acceptance towards PLHIV is very low. As the stigma index reports, 25% of
women and 40% of men in Tanzania do accept interacting with PLHIV. The situation is critical in
rural areas where only 21% of women and 35% of men have positive attitudes toward PLHIV, as
compared to 36% of women and 54% of men in the urban areas.
3.2.2.2 Mobility and Migration
Mobile population groups such as seasonal labourers in plantations, road construction sites, mobile
markets, truck drivers, fishermen and miners are vulnerable to HIV infection because they often
practice higher risk sex with non-marital or co-habitating partners. Studies have found samples
of long-distance truck drivers with high HIV prevalence. These results are consistent with the
findings in the THMIS 2007/08 and 2011/12, which found that individuals who travel away from
home frequently are more likely to be HIV seropositive than those who do not. Among women
in the THMIS 2011/12, those who had slept away from home five or more times in the past 12
months were twice as likely to be HIV seropositive (11%) as those who did not travel away from
home (5%).
3.2.2.3 Gender Inequalities
Women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection than their male counterparts in Tanzania
due to biological, socio-cultural and economic factors. According to UNAIDS, up to 80% of HIV
seropositive women in long term relationship acquired the virus from their partners. This inequality
sometimes results in gender based violence, such as rape, sexual assault and battery. Other
factors such as multiple sexual partnership, polygamy, violence, alcohol, and substance abuse also
play an exacerbating role in reinforcing gender inequalities.
3.2.2.4 Income Inequality and Poverty
There is emerging evidence that income inequality and poverty also play a role in the context of
HIV transmission, as the following points illustrate.
1. HIV prevalence is higher among those employed (6%) than those not employed (3%).
2. Anecdotal evidence indicates that wealthy men and women are engaged in cross-generational
transactional sex with younger or poorer vulnerable groups of either sex who in turn need
money or material benefits. In addition, poverty has been reported to push young girls and
boys into commercial sex work.
3. Inability to afford condoms has in several studies been reported as a barrier to condom usage
or negotiated safe sex.
4. Women who are not sex workers engage in risky sex for purposes of providing food for their
children and survival.
5. Poverty increases vulnerability to fast progression to AIDS, as many poor people get infections
which lower their immunity.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
24
The National HIV and AIDS Policy 2013 also notes that poverty aggravates the intensity of the
impact that HIV and AIDS may have on women, orphans and the disabled.
3.2.3 Biomedical Factors
BIOmedical factors affecting HIV transmission include low levels of male circumcision in some
regions, low coverage of quality assured blood transfusions, non-sterile medical injections, high
prevalence of STIs including Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), high levels of HIV couple discordance,
transmission of infection from parent to child and low levels of self-knowledge about HIV serostatus.
3.2.3.1 Low levels of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC)
Male circumcision has been associated with a decreased risk of HIV infection by men, presumably
because of physiological differences that reduce the susceptibility to HIV infection among HIV-
negative, circumcised men. In Mainland Tanzania, HIV prevalence among circumcised men was
3.5%, compared with 5.2% of uncircumcised men (2013, p. 119). Currently, there is substantial
demographic and regional variation in the prevalence of circumcision. Overall, 70.9% of men have
been circumcised, though the level of male circumcision is substantially higher among urban
men than rural men, 94.2% to 64.2% respectively. More than half of the regions have levels
of circumcision of 50% or more. Male circumcision coverage is lowest in Rukwa (28%), Simiyu
(30%), and Shinyanga (32%) (Ibid., p.87); while the corresponding HIV prevalence in the same
region is 6%, 3.6%, and 7
.4% respectively.
3.2.3.2 Low Coverage of Quality Assured BloodTransfusions
Transfusing blood that has not been screened against HIV virus infection puts the recipient at
an increased risk of being infected. Tanzania has not yet achieved universal (100%) screening of
donated blood for HIV infection; mechanisms to ensure quality and continuity in screening are still
inadequate, particularly at the lower levels of the health system. So far, only 35.7% of the donated
blood in the country is screened for HIV in a quality assured process (Tanzania Country Progress
Report, 2010). The total requirements for Mainland Tanzania are estimated at 436,253 units of
blood in 2012, or 1% of the total population, as per WHO recommendations.
3.2.3.3 Unsafe Medical Injection
WHO estimates globally that at least 5% of new HIV infections are attributed to unsafe, injection
practices. About 2% of women and 3% of men in Tanzania received unsterile medical injections
(2013, p. 90). It had been revealed that only 5% of facilities in the country had all the basic
requirements for infection prevention such as soap, water, gloves and disposable boxes for sharps
(used needles and lancets). About one third of the health units had facilities for adequate disposal
of sharps and bio-hazards materials while only 15% had guidelines for infection prevention control.
3.2.3.4 Prevalence of SexualTransmitted Infection (STI)
It has been established that STIs such as gonorrhoea and syphilis increase an individual's chances
of becoming infected with HIV during unprotected sex. A survey in Mainland Tanzania revealed
that 3.1% of women and 6.9% of men reported having an STI, an abnormal discharge, or a genital
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 25
sore. Similarly elsewhere, evidence has been established between the increased vulnerability of
PLHIV to Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer. Tanzania is a country with
high prevalence of cervical cancer; yet, women's knowledge of HPV screening and cervical cancer
varies greatly by education (52% of women with no education compared to 75% with secondary
education) and wealth (53% of the lowest quintile compared to 82% of the highest quintile) (Ibid.,
p.92).
3.2.3.5 Mother to ChildTransmission of HIV Infection
TDHS (2010) reported that Mother to Child Transmission (MTCT) is the second most common
cause of HIV transmission within the Country. There are two notable gaps; these include low levels
of attendance of ante-natal clinics (out of the 4 recommended visits) and lack of full integration
of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) services in Maternal and Child Health
services. Approximately, 24% of HIV positive pregnant women that attended antenatal clinics
were not reached by PMTCT services and 43% of HIV exposed infants who needed ARVs to
prevent MTCT did not receive it due to limited access to treatment, stock outs of commodities, or
attrition from the programme (TDHS, 2011).
3.2.3.6 High Levels of Discordance and Low Level of Knowledge of HIV Serostatus
Partners that are engaged in unprotected sex while not knowing their serostatus are at an increased
risk of acquiring HIV. A recent survey has established that among the general population, 6% of
couples are discordant with 3.5% of couples indicating the man is infected and 2.8% showing that
the woman is infected. Discordance is more common among urban than rural couples (THMIS
2011-2012).
3.3 ASSESSMENT OFTHE NATIONAL RESPONSE
3.3.1 Organization of National Response to HIV and AIDS inTanzania
TACAIDS has a responsibility of providing multi-sectoral policy guidance and oversight of the
National HIV and AIDS response. Specifically,TACAIDS coordinates the National Multi-sectoral HIV
and AIDS Strategic Framework with the key functions of policy development, resource mobilization,
advocacy, monitoring and evaluation.
The advocacy, monitoring and evaluation of the AIDS response is decentralized to the local
government authorities (LGAs). Planning, implementation and monitoring of the national response
resides with the sectors, which are also decentralized to the LGA levels. The Public Sector has
a defined administrative structure that stretches from the community (village or Mtaa) level, up
to National or Central level. The roles and responsibilities of each of these levels in the National
Response to HIV and AIDS are well defined.
3.3.2 Implementation of the National Response
Elimination of HIV inTanzania demands active and meaningful participation of the entire community,
individually and collectively. This NMSF III provides guidance to all public and non-public sectors
to review and implement well focused, cost effective and results-informed HIV interventions that
target the individual person and the entire sector according to the epidemiology and the comparative
advantages of each sector in order to achieve the three zeros. The process of developing and
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
26
implementing the sectors' strategic plans will be undertaken under the leadership of the chief
executive officers who will also be responsible and accountable for the results. The sectors will
closely monitor and submit performance reports to the Prime Minister's Office through TACAIDS.
3.3.3 Achievements of the National Response
Overall, the HIV prevalence of MainlandTanzania declined between national surveys undertaken in
2004 (7%) and 2012 (5.3 %). There was no statistical significant decline between the two most
recent surveys in 2008 (5.7%) and 2012 (5.3 %). HIV Counselling andTesting sites increased from
1,035 in 2009 to 2,168 by the end of December 2012. Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling
(PITC) was available in all hospitals and 50% of health centres. The total number of new clients
pre-test counselled and tested increased from 998,887 reported in 2009 to 1,009,691 by end of
2010.
3.4 GAPS AND CHALLENGES OFTHE NATIONAL RESPONSE
3.4.1 Gaps and Challenges in HIV Prevention
3.4.1.1 Knowledge of HIV and AIDS
There is a huge difference between awareness of the epidemic and specific knowledge of how to
prevent transmission and acquisition. There are notable differences among different age groups
in comprehensive knowledge of HIV prevention. Although there is no clear relationship between
older age and better knowledge, youths aged 15-19 appear to have lower knowledge than those in
older age groups. Knowledge of HIV prevention methods is lowest among those who have never
had sex. Levels of knowledge of preventive methods are higher in urban than in rural areas.
3.4.1.2 Prevention of Mother to ChildTransmission (PMTCT)
Many HIV positive women and HIV exposed infants still do not access Prevention of Mother to
Child Transmission (PMTCT) services. About 30% of all HIV positive pregnant women in need
of ARV therapy to reduce the risk of MTCT did not access eMTCT services at all in 2011; 44%
of all children at risk of HIV infection from their mothers did not access ARV for PMTCT. This
could partly be explained by the RCH service utilization pattern by pregnant women. The TDHS
(2010) shows that while 96% of women have had at least one ANC visit, only 43% had attained
the recommended minimum of 4 ANC visits. This trend coincides with higher HIV testing that is
done at first visit and very low ARV prophylaxis uptake for mothers and their infants later in the
postpartum period.
Inadequate community and male partner involvement are the main challenges to attain eMTCT;
70% of health facilities did not provide Early Infant Diagnosis (EID) services and 43% of HIV
exposed infants did not receive any prophylaxis to prevent MTCT. Even facilities with EID services
experience long delays in specimen transport, testing and provision of results that threaten the
health of infants with HIV infection at the time when they are most likely to die from this infection.
Promotion of Option B+ to enrol all HIV seropositive women into lifelong ART is being used to
address some of the existing service gaps but in itself will be inadequate to reach all HIV positive
women and exposed infants with sustained, quality life-saving interventions.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 27
3.4.1.3 HIVTesting and Counselling (HTC)
The challenges in the implementation of HTC services include low utilization of the VCT services
especially in rural areas due to long distances; inadequate human resources; stigma and
discrimination, gender inequalities and gender based violence; limited couple testing; and low
disclosure of HIV test results to partners preventing efforts to make informed health decisions
such as use of condoms.
Programmatic gaps arising as a result of the above challenges include: 47% of men and 62% of
women aged 15-49 were tested and received results leading to a gap of 53% for men and 38% for
women that needs HTC services. PITC services had not been rolled out in 50% of health centres
and in all dispensaries considering that health centres and dispensaries serve over 80% of the
country's population.
3.4.1.4 BloodTransfusion
As previously mentioned, only 35.7% of Tanzania blood supply is quality assured as per WHO
standards.
3.4.1.5 Scaling up Male Circumcision
The National Strategy onVoluntary Medical Male Circumcision had targeted to circumcise 2, 800,000
adult males in 12 priority regions by 2015. However, the programme managed to circumcise only
415, 398 (15 %) up to December, 2012. This intervention will now aim at targeting sexually active
men in the non-circumcising and high HIV prevalence regions for short term impact and targeting
younger males for long term impact. The regions targeted are Rukwa, Mbeya, Iringa, Kagera,
Mwanza, Tabora, Shinyanga, Njombe, Geita, Simiyu, Katavi and Rorya district in Mara region.
3.4.1.6 Key Populations (KPs)
Access to services and interventions for key population groups is limited by stigma, criminalization
and risky behaviour practices towards cross-infection among key population groups and the general
population is high. The main challenges include limited data on key populations beyond Dar es
Salaam, limited coordination of implementers working with key populations, and lack of national
standards or strategies for interventions targeting KPs.
Programmatic gaps identified include: countrywide KPs magnitude and dynamics is still unknown;
inadequate user friendly services for KPs; the gap in terms of comprehensive package of services
and effective interventions, resulting in insufficient coverage and utilization of HIV treatment and
prevention services by KPs (NMSF II Evaluation Report, 2012).
3.4.1.7 Mainstreaming HIV and AIDS interventions
While the private sector, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and Faith Based Organizations (FBOs)
have been actively mainstreaming HIV interventions in their workplaces, workplace interventions
outside the public sector has been limited; furthermore, both private and public sector external
mainstreaming has also been weak. The expanding private sector highly justifies increasing
information and strengthening service interventions at workplaces. Existing anecdotal evidence
suggests that stigma and discrimination against health workers and school teachers living with HIV
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
28
and AIDS is high. In other sectors, demand for information about rights, duties and care of public
servants is high but there are limited services and sexual harassment and abuse of power is a
perceived risk factor for HIV transmission.
3.4.2 Gaps and Chalenges in Care,Treatment and Support
3.4.2.1 Enrolment in Care andTreatment
By June 2012, one-third (34%) of PLHIV had not been enrolled for care: only 54% of all children
and adults enrolled in care and treatment were ever enrolled on ARVs as of March 2012 and these
constituted 41% of the estimated total of PLHIV. Thus, both the overall target of enrolling 90%
of PLHIV on ART and 18% of all enrolled PLHIV on ART as children has not been met. There is
significantly low (35%) enrolment of males in care and treatment and have shown to report late
for treatment (MoHSW, 2011). Nevertheless, the number of people estimated to be infected with
HIV has held steady because of ongoing new infections, population growth, and the availability
of life-sustaining treatment for those infected. The cumulative number of clients on antiretroviral
treatment (ART) as of June 2012 was 626,444, surpassing the "3 by 5" target of 440,000 by 2011.
The country however, has reported the following challenges:
(i) Existence of a weak referral and networking system; inadequate supervision and support
to counsellors; non adherence to national HTC guidelines; as well as existence of poor
infrastructure which compromise privacy and confidentiality.
(ii) Failure to adhere on treatment (on and off) due to various reasons; over advertisement of
alternative medicine such as kikombe cha Babu.
(iii) Lack of mechanism to track the clients who receive treatment at another facility leading into
Loss to Follow-up (LTF).
(iv) Poor integration of HIV care and treatment with other general servicesTB/RCH/Immunization.
(v) Lack of collaboration /coordination between facility and community activities and poor
linkage of HBC and care and treatment facility.
(vi) Critical shortage of skilled Health Care Providers and those currently trained for ART care are
not evenly distributed.
(vii) Inadequate infrastructure of the health system in general to cope with increasing number of
patients who are on lifelong treatment.
(viii) Scarcity of resources forARV and other HIV commodities example-CD4 testing is inadequate,
erratic and not accessible to some facilities.
3.4.2.2 HIV and AIDSTrained Human Resources for Health
The system faces daunting challenges with regard to staffing. An estimated 40% of the staff
positions in health facilities are unfilled and the burden of HIV and AIDS is stressing the already
overburdened system (TACAIDS, 2012).
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 29
3.4.2.3 Facilities, Equipment and System Delivery
There are 6,342 registered health facilities in Tanzania of which 1,403 (22%) are providing ART
services. Equipment, planning and distribution of services and a tracking mechanism of clients on
treatment also leaves critical gaps. Resources to support Home Based Care are low and community
mobilization remains inadequate. Majority of care giving is undertaken by women and girls and
interventions that promote and support equal sharing of responsibilities between men and women
in families and communities remain limited. There is no up-to-date record of the number of service
providers trained per category, appropriately deployed or exiting ART care and treatment.
3.4.2.4 HIV/TB Collaboration
In HIV and TB collaboration, currently services are not sufficiently linked with the efficiency of the
surveillance system especially the comprehensiveness of the database on co-infected patients is
weak due lack of TB/HIV health education in all sectors, together with existing buildings being not
in compliance with TB infection control. Challenges include:
(i) Increase case finding and diagnosis of TB in people living with HIV
(ii) Slow initiation of Isoniazid Preventative Therapy among PLHIV
(iii) Poor implementation of TB Infection Control measures in health facilities and inadequate
integration on TB and HIV treatment.
3.4.3 Gaps and Challenges in Social and Economic Impact Mitigation
3.4.3.1 PLHIV/OVC and their Households
Poverty and lack of well-developed national and community supporting systems have impeded
PLHIV and OVC access to quality care and support services. Studies indicate that community
based care programs increase access to important interventions for people living with HIV and
those affected by HIV and AIDS. Community programs support mobilization on harmful behavioural
awareness creation, provision of community and home-based care services, facilitate linkage and
referral to health facilities for facility-based services. However, community programs are not well
recognized, supported and funded despite the fact that they play critical catalytic role in ensuring
healthy living of the people affected and living with HIV and AIDS. In HIV and AIDS programming,
the community interventions support delivery of care and support services and promote retention
in HIV care. Furthermore, some community-based models serve to bridge the gap of distance
and service provision between health facilities and households as they provide some clinical care
services in the community, such as mobile care services, ARV refills, OI distribution and other
services.
Additional gaps in addressing the PLHIV were reported in the NMSF II Evaluation Report (2012) as:
(i) Limited universal access to adequate and quality care and treatment services for PLHIV,
Reproductive Health, TB/HIV, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and Opportunistic
Infections (OI).
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
30
(ii) Mapping and setting priorities to address the needs of affected families and PWHIV and
monitoring the changes in the priorities and capacities of care giving families and adjusting
programmes accordingly.
Gaps in services for orphans and other most vulnerable children are:
(i) Capacity building of CSOs and community structures to facilitate the work of caregivers of
different ages and gender groups.
(ii) Inadequate allocation of resources and poor coordination of activities undertaken by different
stakeholders at regional and district levels.
(iii) Lack of coordination among stakeholders with common interest of working with elderly
living with HIV or those taking care of relatives living with HIV.
(iv) Low rate of reporting through TOMSHA to 60%
(v) Inadequate reproductive Health, TB/HIV, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and
Opportunistic Infections (OI) treatment services.
Gaps related to involvement of PLHIV and their networks include:
(i) Inadequate involvement of PLHIV in joint planning, reporting and monitoring forum at district
level,
(ii) Inadequate Joint efforts and collaboration between District clusters and PLHIV Networks
inadequate collaboration between networks of PLHIV.
(iii) Inadequate capacity of network members to manage and implement interventions.
As indicated in the NMSF II Evaluation Report (2012), 28% of identified MVCs did not receive core
services including health care, psychosocial support, food and nutrition, and education support.
Nearly one-third of the councils have not undertaken MVC identification processes.The magnitude
of need and level of support even in districts that have undertaken the identification of MVC is yet
to be verified calling for the mapping of MVC, service providers and regularly updated database
and the strengthening of the follow-up system. Other gaps include:
(i) Inadequate capacity of Village MVC and CMA and Committees to handle MVCs
interventions and allocation of resources leading to low coverage of services provided.
(ii) Inadequate coordination of activities undertaken by different stakeholders at regional and
district levels. Include disabled and elderly in relation to HIV services.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 31
3.4.3.2 Informal Sector HIV Response
The informal sector is a key contributor to the national economy; however, its contribution to the
HIV national response is not well coordinated and documented. Policy makers and advocates
will have to make evidence-informed decisions to mainstream HIV and AIDS in their social and
economic services. The informal sector has untapped potential for financing its own response.
3.4.4 Gaps and Challenges in Monitoring, Evaluation and Research
The National HIV and AIDS Evaluation and Research Agenda (NHAREA) has been completed
and already disseminated at the national level. In addition, the NHAREA was developed at the
time when the new national priorities for the elimination of HIV were not yet adopted. With
the development of NMSF III, there is need to review the Research Agenda to address the new
priorities, gaps and challenges taking into consideration existing national capacities and challenges
for responding to the epidemic.
Gaps in M&E and Research can be grouped into the following categories:
(i) Human Resources, including technically qualified M&E, in data collection, processing and
utilization. At regional level, where personnel responsible for M&E functions have been
appointed, there are often no specific M&E units.
(ii) Advocacy for HIV Strategy does not sufficiently reflect M&E issues. There is a lack of a multi-
sectoral operational plan development and implementation.
(iii) M&E Standards, harmonization and coordination among Tanzania multiple partners and
reporting requirements.
(iv) Insufficient research for addressing qualitative and quantitative aspects of the determinants
of the epidemic.
3.4.5 Financing of the National Response
Successful implementation of the national response depends a lot on the availability of adequate
financial resources. The organization of funding the national response is the responsibility of the
government ofTanzania.The government recognizes the importance of fulfilling global and regional
commitments to HIV and AIDS financing and in this regard will continue to increase the level of
funding, establish an HIV and AIDSTrust Fund and develop mechanisms to coordinate contributions
from the private sector, CSOs informal sector and development partners.
The NMSF II (2008 -2012) was costed in order to provide indication of financial resources required
for the HIV and AIDS response in the country.The costed Strategy estimated total requirements of
Tshs. 1 trillion shillings per year forTanzania response. HIV and AIDS services especially treatment,
prevention, enabling environment and impact mitigation are still in high need of resources. Treatment
programme has only achieved about 60% of the requirements, WHO treatment guidelines by the
country has revised its care and treatment guidelines to reflect the recommendations of WHO
and has agreed to go for option B+ eliminate mother to child transmission (eMTCT). These two
changes will demand more funds and approximately 118 billionTshs. for five years.There is a need
to scale up PMTCT which is still below the targets.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
32
3.4.5.1 The Government ofTanzania
The Government of Tanzania's contribution to HIV and AIDS has been more than 20 million USD
per year from the central government, including Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs)
contribution budgeted under respective Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs). It is
estimated that every MDA uses up to 5% of the allocated budget for HIV and AIDS activities. Most
of the activities carried out are related to workplace programs. HoweverTanzania needs to make a
transition from the conventional workplace programs to designing multi-sectoral responses to the
epidemic e.g. the agricultural sector planning for and implementing programs that will ascertain
food security for PLWHA.
Local Government Authorities play important role in response to HIV by providing its collected 5%
of public revenue (from various fees, charges, levies and taxes set locally. Examples of the taxes
are property taxes, charcoal and wood fees, forest products fees, livestock auction fee, produce
cess, service levy, land rent and others) 20% is to be spent on HIV and AIDS. In the financial year
2012/13 expenditure of this collected public revenue has increased to 25%. More advocacy is
required to raise the amount of LGA own sources allocated to HIV and AIDS response.
Total of 21 billion Tanzania shillings (US$ 13 million) is budgeted and spent on HIV and AIDS at the
LGAs level every year. There are total of 17 different sources of funding for HIV and AIDS at the
LGAs level ­ including block grants, multilateral, bilateral, NGOs and own sources.
Own source local revenue accounted for 10% of LGAs resources (prior to rationalization), which
has now reduced to about 5%.These are collections by the LGAs from various fees, charges, levies
and taxes set locally. Examples of the taxes are property taxes, charcoal and wood fees, forest
products fees, livestock auction fee, produce cess, service levy, land rent and others. Experience
has shown that these sources have been financing HIV and AIDS up to about 2% of the collected
own sources.
3.4.5.2 Development Partners
There has been a declining trend of HIV and AIDS financial resource over the last four years.
Changes of financing mechanisms for some of the Development Partners (bilateral and multilateral
and the World economic recession affecting most of these countries are some of the reasons
contributing to this trend. Tanzania has been fortunate to attract donors and their contribution is
almost 71% of the HIV and AIDS resources to our national response.
3.4.5.3 Global Fund
Tanzania is the beneficiary of the Global Fund and implements various grants under Global Fund.
Global Fund Round 4 Rolling Continuation Channel aims to make availability of affordable condoms
at the community and private sectors. Global Fund Round 6 focused on HIV/TB co-infection with
HIV prevention and treatment components designed to cover 31 districts. The programme ended
in 2012 and subsequently TB programme has been supported through a two year transitional
funding mechanism. Global Fund Round 8 phase I and II focus on procurement of HIV and AIDS
commodities for the period of 2008-2015. Global Fund Round 9 focuses on the Health System
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 33
Strengthening (HSS) and the negotiation of phase II is going on with Global Fund. The Global
financing mechanism has changed from round based project application to new funding model,
which requires countries to apply on yearly basis.The new funding model will rely on countries HIV
and AIDS strategic plan requirements as well as counterpart funding.
3.4.5.4 PEPFAR Partnership Framework
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) started being implemented in Tanzania
in 2004. The program areas of support include Home-Based Care and Support, Antiretroviral
Therapy Program, Voluntary Counselling and Testing, improvement of infrastructure of HIV care
and treatment centres, Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission on HIV, prevention of HIV
transmission through blood transfusion and contaminated instruments, orphans vulnerable children
and community outreach HIV and AIDS prevention programs that promote abstinence and/or being
faithful. PEPFAR program contributes about USD 361 million a year, which is about 71% of the
total donor support for HIV and AIDS programme in Tanzania. The first phase of the programme
covered five years from 2004 to 2008.
PEPFAR partnership framework is in the second phase (2009 to 2013). The programme sets
for a paradigm shift from a `donor-recipient' relationship to one partnership embodied by both
governments. It outlines (mutual, non-binding) commitments and responsibilities for the USG and
GOT. It also sets forth expected progress over time of USG support, GOT investment and policy
change. This phase focuses on the sustainability through strengthening local organizations (public
and CSO) to lead, manage, and implement various HIV and AIDS programs. One of the focuses
includes Global Fund Implementation in the country and close collaboration with Global Fund.
PEPFAR new program will be implemented for another five years (2013-2017).

3.4.5.5 NMSF Grant
NMSF Grant supports implementation of HIV and AIDS interventions at the districts and Local
Government Authorities (LGAs) levels up to the wards and village levels. The grant allocates
resources to LGAs for implementation and to the Regional Secretariats (RS) for supportive
supervision and monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the NMSF
.TACAIDS and Prime
Minister's Office ­ Regional Administration and Local Government (PMO-RALG) are supported to
oversee and coordinate the program.This programme is supported by the Governments of Canada
and Denmark.
The funds are shared among districts according to a mutually agreed and transparent allocation
formula in which; population accounts for 70%, number of residents who are below national poverty
line 10%, district medical vehicle route 10% and HIV prevalence of the region 10%. Support of
NMSF Grant is of increasing trend as indicated in figure 8. Disbursements to Local Government
Authorities have been 100% of the planned activities in the last two years.

3.4.5.6 United Nations Development Assistance Plan (UNDAP)
HIV and AIDS activities have been mainstreamed into the sectoral activities implemented in the
government ministries through UN Agencies focussing on strengthening the country systems,
policies and processes.This enables the country to build national capacity to deliver basic services
while increasing coverage and quality. The UN programme is financed through UN agencies' own
resources and additional funding provided by donors. Some of UN agencies implementing this
programme are UNDP
, UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNICEF
, WHO, WFP
, ILO, UNESC, UNODC and UNIFEM.
The mentioned above UN agencies are dealing with education, labour and employment, gender,
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 35
children, development, agriculture, food security and health. The UN agencies use their mandates
to bring in changes into the Tanzania national response to HIV and AIDS. Implementation of this
program is being overseen by the National Steering Committee.
Figure 9: UNDAP HIV and AIDS FinancialTrend
Source: TACAIDS reports (2009 -2013)
3.4.5.7 The Private Sector
Tanzania estimates to have about 400 formal companies. The private sector and CSOs play an
important role in the HIV and AIDS response in the country contributing about 2% of the funding
used for the HIV national response per year (PER 2012). The services supported include HIV
prevention, care and support, impact mitigation and advocacy.
Private companies fund their HIV and AIDS workplace programs largely from own sources, while
services provided by Civil Society Organizations CSOs are funded by various sources which include
Rapid Funding Envelope (RFE), Foundation for Civil Society, the Global Fund through Africa Medical
Research Foundation (AMREF), President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), Christian
Social Services Commission (CSSC) and other direct donor assistance.
Establishment ofAIDSTrust Fund forTanzania will facilitate a mechanism and an enabling environment
for the private sector to contribute more to the HIV national response. The Public Expenditure
Review (2012) indicated that 15% of the companies are willing to support and contribute to AIDS
Trust Fund. More advocacy for private sector response to HIV and AIDS is required and the country
should ensure private sector HIV and AIDS interventions are coordinated and in synchrony with the
NMSF III. Greater emphasis must also be placed on their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in
line with the priorities of the nation.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
36
3.4.6 Gap in Resource Mobilization, Allocation and Accountability
Government's contribution to the HIV and AIDS response declined by 22% from 14 Billion (Year
2008/9) to 11 Billion (2011/12). Government contribution to the national response accounts for
10%. However, the government contributions do not include structures, human resources and
their remunerations.
The total requirement for NMSF II (2008 -2012) was TShs 1 trillion per year; however, only 50%
was available.
Figure 10: Government ofTanzania HIV and AIDS FinancingTrend
Source: Ministry of Finance reports (2001 ­ 2013)
The recent study on the private sector financing HIV and AIDS in Tanzania observed that private
sector finances HIV and AIDS by 2%. National Health Insurance Fund finances HIV and AIDS
treatment by 1%. This is mainly for public servants and their supported families who access the
health services.
The accountability of audit tracking of expenditures has shown weaknesses in the lower level HIV
and AIDS accountability structures such as absence of system of oversight mechanisms for their
performance, non-equitable allocation geographically and non-alignment of resource allocation
with priorities, especially in the prevention area which was given only an average of 23%. The
2011/12 Controller and Auditor General's Report and an independent study of 10 councils, noted
the need for improving governance for HIV and AIDS funding in LGAs.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 37
3.4.7 Gaps and challenges in the Enabling Environment
The HIV and AIDS response has for the last three decades undergone changes in focus. From HIV
and AIDS as a strictly health issue, to addressing AIDS as a multi-sectoral challenge that calls for
all actors to respond. With the developments and scaling up of interventions in prevention, care
and treatment, there is now a global and national call for the elimination of new infections, end of
AIDS related deaths and end of stigma and discrimination. The new priorities demand structural
changes, transformative conceptualization, and strengthening of sector strategy planning, namely:
· Governance, oversight and coordination of the national response to HIV and AIDS require
strong government, civil society, and PLHIV engagement.
· NMSF structures have been established for state and non-state actors at all levels. However,
their performance has been low due to the following gaps: Lack of understanding of roles
of different actors at sub-national levels; inadequate planning capacity within sub-national
structures; lack of coordination of sectoral AIDS structures; and inadequate capacity of
secretariat and leadership of structures.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)

4 Strategic Results Framework
The commitment to eliminating HIV in Tanzania requires a strategic process guided by NMSF III through
2018. This chapter describes the process through which the long term impacts of Zero New HIV Infections,
Zero AIDS-Related Deaths, and Zero Stigma and Discrimination will be tracked and achieved. Quantitatively
tracking these desired impacts remains a challenge; however, targeted outcomes of the strategic areas
of investment will inform overall progress. Effective implementation of the five strategic areas of primary
investments, six supportive areas of secondary investments, and five cross-cutting programmatic
principles will therefore be monitored and evaluated with specific, measureable, achievable, realistic and
time-bound (SMART) indicators and targets. Under NMSF III the following overarching impact-level results
will be achieved by 2017/18 namely;
1. The incidence of HIV in the general population is halved by 2018.
2. A significant reduction in AIDS-related deaths among people living with HIV and AIDS.
3. Reduced stigma and discrimination among PLHIV.
Table: Indicators for measuring impact of the NMSF III with respective baselines and targets
Impact Indicator Baseline Target 2017/18
1 HIV incidence rate in the general population 0.32% (2012) 0.16%
2 % of PLHIV on ART are alive after 12 months 74 (2011) 80%
3 % of people expressing or accepting attitudes
towards people living with HIV and AIDS
31.9% (2012) 40%
To achieve the above results the following outcomes are expected:
· Proportion of eligible PLHIV on care and treatment increased and sustained.
· Increased access and quality of HIV Testing and Counselling.
· Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission.
· Increased male and female condom use by men and women during risky sex
· Elimination of blood borne transmission of HIV.
· Reduced risky behaviour of sexual intercourse among the general, infected, most-at-risk and
vulnerable populations.
· Increased prevalence of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC).
· Increased access and quality of treatment of (STIs).
· Community Based Care and Support Interventions response to HIV within their local context.
· HIV mainstreamed in sector-specific policies and strategies.
· Reduction of all HIV and AIDS related stigma and discrimination.
The NMSF III will achieve these outcomes through the following strategic investment areas:-
CHAPTER FOUR
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 39
4.1 STRATEGIC AREAS OF PRIMARY INVESTMENT
1. Comprehensive Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) service delivery is the single most important
investment in the NMSF III. Scaling up and sustaining access to and retention in treatment, care
and support interventions, along with investments in infrastructure, procurement and supply chain
management, require exceptional programme management to ensure the continuous availability
of ART for all HIV-positive Tanzanians.
2. HIV Counselling and Testing with effective linkages to facility- and community-based services that
respects human rights, informed consent, focuses on high disease burden areas, as well as
mobile, hard-to-reach, and key populations (including discordant couples, sex workers, men who
have sex with men, women who have anal sex, people who inject drugs, and others at highest
risk).
3. Elimination of Mother to Child Transmission includes the adoption and implementation of PMTCT
option B+ throughout the country, providing testing and counselling to all prospective mothers and
placing all HIV positive mothers on life saving ART.
4. Comprehensive Sexuality, Gender, and Health Education and Services includes all necessary
investments in curricula and training for the provision of facility and community based interventions
that deliver a comprehensive package of education and services relating to sexuality, gender, and
health for the HIV national response.
5. Condom Provision and Programming employs targeted and innovative strategies to increase the
availability and access to male and female condoms and water-based lubricants, through both the
private and public sectors.
4.2 SUPPORTING AREAS OF SECONDARY INVESTMENT
1. Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) is being expanded into geographic areas with low
circumcision rates.
2. Provision of Safe Blood requires the quality assurance and effective screening of voluntary non-
remunerated blood donors for 100% of the country's blood needs.
3. Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) is being improved through the integration of
STI services with other health services, with special attention given to stigma-free services for key
populations.
4. Targeted Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) across the strategic programmes is designed
to increase the demand for services, enhance knowledge, and lead to positive changes in risky
behaviours at personal, community and national levels.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
40
5. Community Based Care and Support Interventions are designed to improve referrals and linkages to
services (such as health, social welfare, and economic support) as well as address the stigmatization
of PLHIV and key populations in communities. These interventions will both reduce the numbers
of lost-to-follow-up (LTFU) clients and improve the overall social environment for PLHIV.
6. Mainstreaming of HIV and AIDS interventions in the routine activities of all sectors will ensure
that demand is created for HIV and AIDS services, the public is informed about the realities of
the disease and its effective treatment, and that stigma and discrimination against PLHIV and key
populations are addressed across all segments of society. This includes workplace interventions
in both the public and private sectors.
4.3 CROSS-CUTTING PROGRAMMATIC PRINCIPLES
1. Integration ensures that segregation of duties and duplication of efforts will be avoided whenever
possible. Integration of ART, PMTCT, and RCH clinics is one example. Consolidation of trainings,
supervision budgets, and human resources are other examples.
2. Demand Creation means that all programme components must be complemented by civil society
efforts, the public, private, and informal sectors, to create demand for high quality services within
the targeted communities.
3. Human Rights as a principle means that laws, policies, and education programmes will always
safeguard the rights to health services, informed consent, and protection under the law, particularly
for PLHIV and key populations.
4. Gender as a principle means that all programme activities need to address the disparities that
result from gender discrimination and gender-based violence.
5. Programme Strengthening builds the service platforms in the country by which HIV prevention,
care, treatment, and multi-sectoral support services are performed.
4.4 RESULTSTOWARDSTHREE ZEROS
4.4.1 Towards Zero New HIV Infections
Testing for recent seroconversions in nationally and regionally representative samples using
recommended and approved tests will provide the highest level of assurance that the numbers
of new infection are, in fact, steadily decreasing. While promoting this quality of data collection
for the future, the NMSF III shall use modelling from prevalence data to set incidence targets
for the time being. In setting both incidence and antiretroviral treatment targets, the NMSF III
specifies that the ratio of new infections to persons newly initiated on Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)
should not exceed 1.0. This ratio should remain below 1.0 throughout the implementation period
of the NMSF III, as a result of the aggressive ART targets, through both the existing and planned
modifications of treatment guidelines, including implementation of PMTCT Option B+. Outcome
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 41
indicators from each of the eleven (11) strategic investment areas will track progress towards this
long-term impact. The impact result will be an HIV incidence rate (either directly measured or
modelled)of less than 0.16% by 2017 (from a baseline of 0.32% in 2012).
4.4.2 Towards Zero AIDS-Related Deaths
Ongoing scale-up of ART will definitively save lives, reducing AIDS-related deaths. Clinical
assessments of all deaths with comprehensive HIV co-morbidity records and any other approved
approaches would be necessary to validate the evidence of elimination of AIDS-related deaths in
Tanzania. While promoting improvements in vital registration and verbal autopsies of community
and facility deaths as soon as possible in order to establish a baseline, the NMSF III employs
both the HIV patient monitoring system (CTC database) and prevalence surveys (THMIS) for
setting outcome targets related to provision of effective care and treatment with antiretroviral
therapy. Outcome indicators relating to the performance of three areas of primary investment
(Comprehensive Services, HTC, and ART) will track progress in identifying PLHIV, serving them in
their communities, and ensuring their access to life saving treatment. The impact result will be
significant reductions in AIDS related deaths by 2017
.
4.4.3 Towards Zero Stigma and Discrimination
Robust and nationally representative participation from all segments of PLHIV, including under-
served and key populations, is essential to verifying that no one living with HIV is subjected to
stigma and discrimination. While promoting and coordinating the expansion and effectiveness
of related stakeholder organizations, the NMSF III uses nationally and regionally representative
surveys (THMIS) to set targets for proxy indicators. Outcome indicators from all strategic areas
inform the social and epidemiological context in which stigma and discrimination occur; while the
primary investment areas of comprehensive sexuality, gender, and health education and services,
and the supporting investment area of behaviour change communication are targeting Zero Stigma
and Discrimination. The impact result will be reduced stigma and discrimination among PLHIV
(including KP).

Management and Coordination will entail: (1) Coordination structures and implementation
arrangements (2) Gender and human rights (3) Individual centred HIV response (4) Stigma, denial,
discrimination and regional and global coordination and mobilization of resources both financial and
physical. Strategies for each priority area is as detailed below:
4.7.1 Priority Area 1: Align functional coordinating structures to NMSF III
Priority strategies:
(i) Develop TACAIDS institutional milestones for multi-sectoral HIV and AIDS coordination;
(ii) Review and strengthen coordination and reporting mechanisms at national, regional and LGA
levels.
(iii) Build infrastructural and technical capacity of secretariats of non-state actors to best
coordinate (plan, mobilize, monitor implementation and reporting) their constituencies;
(iv) Develop financing mechanisms to ensure non-state coordinating entities are functional;
(v) Support self-coordinating entities to develop consolidated work plans that address NMSF III
results;
(vi) Hold annual reviews of work plans and report toTACAIDS on the progress towards set goals
of non-state organizations;
(vii) Support ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) in costing their NMSF III aligned work
plans; and
(viii) Build capacity of LGAs and community HIV and AIDS response.
4.7.2 Priority Area 2: Reduction of Gender Inequalities and Gender Based Violence
The priority strategy is to ensure that all sectors implement the Gender Operational Plan for HIV
(GOPH) Response in Tanzania Mainland (GOP
, 2010).
Strategies;
(i) Manage strategic information flow to determine the connection between the GBV and HIV
and AIDS in Tanzania.
(ii) Promote public participation in the ownership of the results of the three (3) zeros
(iii) Build leadership capacity among women, men, PLHIV and other key populations to engage
in national HIV and AIDS response towards attaining national priorities
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
56
(iv) Ensure active participation of women and men at all levels of the implementation of the
NMSF III. Support roll out and implementation of the Multisectoral Plan of Action to Prevent
and Respond to Violence against Children (VAC Plan of Action 2013-2016)
Strengthen government-led and community-driven responses which will facilitate OVC accessing
adequate care, support and protection services through increasingly integrated and sustainable
approaches.
4.7.3 Priority Area 3: Individual and House Hold Centred HIV and AIDS Response
To better prevent new HIV infections, ensure more uptake of enrolment and adherence to treatment
and effectively addresses stigmatizing attitudes. The framework emphasizes individual perception
of risk to infection, understanding of the danger of failure to attain optimum care and sustenance
of treatment, and the cost of stigma and discrimination towards the overall results of the response.
NMSF III emphasizes on the following strategies:
Strategies:
(i) To work with political and civil leadership to explain individual HIV risk perception, responsibility
towards prevention of new HIV infections; promoting access of the population to care and
treatment; and mitigation of the impact of the epidemic on PLHIV and their households.
(ii) Develop consolidated sectoral plans for promotion of personal HIV risk perception and
personal protection.
(iii) Enforce developed policies and by-laws to protect the rights of PLHIV.
(iv) Promote media (local and national) in promoting personal risk and responsibility to HIV
prevention.
(v) Ensure rights and responsibilities of people living with HIV and/or those affected by HIV.
(vi) Develop programs that support enhancing self-esteem of PLHIV such as task sharing at CTC,
PMTCT, home based care, VCT etc.
(vii) Develop and utilize communication and motivation tools for PLHIV to know their rights and
responsibilities.
4.7.4 Priority Area 4: National Response is harmonized with Regional and Global Protocols
Strategies;
(i) Advocate for the use of the NMSF III in negotiating future regional and global protocols.
(ii) Advocate for the implementation of cross-border initiatives especially those related to
prevention, care and treatment.
(iii) Ensure timely collection, processing and reporting on all major indicators in line with national
commitments in the regional and global agenda.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 57
(iv) Enhance cross learning between other areas of health, development and HIV programming,
and development of AIDS programmes based on country context and priorities.
4.7.5 Priority Area 5: Resources Mobilization, Disbursement and Management
The government's contribution to the HIV and AIDS response declined by 50% from 22 Billion (Year
2006/7) to 11 Billion (2010/11) or 33% of the actual value of 2006 if inflation is factored in. Around
95 % of all HIV funds come from international donors, whereas 5.0 % came from government.
The government's contribution does not factor in in-kind or indirect costs such as infrastructure,
human resources, transport and health system at large. This caused the calls for government to
undertake the study to determine government contribution.The heavy reliance on external sources
presents challenges in terms of sustainability. At the same time, stability in the level of external
funding is a compromise to ensure the medium term continuity of service provision.
4.7.5.1 Government Contribution
Although government expenditure in the national response has been extremely low ie 5% of the
total budget, government commitment was noted in creating a strategic objective on HIV and
AIDS within the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Continued resource mobilization
from both internal and external sources and its sustainability, especially for the prevention and
treatment and care of PLHIV, is crucial and will continue to be an important element of the National
Response. TACAIDS during the life of NMSF III will enhance efforts towards securing increased
funding from the government, in addition to tapping existing devolved funds operating at the
District /council levels, among others in an effort to mitigate this risk.
4.7.5.2 Key Partners/Funders
Currently, Development Partners provide the bulk of the funding for HIV interventions in Tanzania.
According to PER 2012 the main international donors are the U.S., President's Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief PEPFAR (71%) and Global Fund (20%). Other major Development Partners (10%)
include DANIDA (Denmark), GIZ (Germany), Canada and UN agencies. The major donors for the
NMSF III period are anticipated to be PEPFAR and Global Fund. PEPFAR support has remained
steady from approximately US$350 million annually. As far as Global Fund is concerned, on-going
projects (Round 8) will run until 2015 while Tanzania will be eligible to apply via the new funding
model in 2014.In response to the observed HIV financing trend, the Government of Tanzania is
increasing the budget allocation for health and HIV and AIDS and by establishing the AIDS Trust
Fund (ATF).
4.7.5.3 Funding Priority Strategies
· Advocate for a National Public-Private Partnership for HIV and AIDS Framework.
· Develop and operationalize the national resource mobilization strategy.
· Develop a costed-plan of action for the NMSF III based on funding only appropriately targeted
evidence-informed interventions and strategies for attaining national results.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
58
· Scrutinize the use of all donor funds to ensure that they are budgeted in costed work plans at
both the partner and donor level.
· Strengthening good governance and accountability of HIV and AIDS resources at all levels.
· Advocate for Health financing strategy.
· Advocate for fast tracking for the implementation of the Tanzania AIDS Trust Fund.
· Institute a regular resource tracking mechanism of HIV and AIDS resources.
· Develop mechanism for Regional Secretariat, LGAs and Community, Private and informal
sector to contribute to HIV and AIDS resources.
· Undertake a study to cost GOT non ­ monetary forms of contributions to HIV and AIDS.
· Advocate for HIV Resource Mobilisation from internal and external funding sources.
· Strengthen financing and disbursement mechanisms including pooling of funds.
4.7.5.4 Resource Allocation
There should be equitable distribution of resources in urban and rural settings depending on the
magnitude of the epidemic and the size of the targeted population. The NMSF III advocates for
proper allocation of funds to different implementers and community groups. Adequate amount
OF funds will be channelled to civil society and private sector organisations that are targeting
marginalized groups that are often not reached by regular public services oriented towards the
general population. Refinement of THMIS to capture adult and paediatric HIV prevalence data at
the district level and improvement in planning and monitoring mechanisms will enable central
coordinating bodies to ensure correction of this disproportionate resource allocation.
4.8 FINANCIAL AUDITS
Financial Audits will be performed regularly (on a yearly basis) to verify that spending mechanisms
follow national and international regulations. The internal and external audits within MDAs will
perform the task to ensure that procurement and tender regulations are strictly followed for all
purchases and management of activities according to the yearly work plan and to government's
requirements.
To track HIV-related expenditure in a calendar year, the Public Expenditure Review, National AIDS
Spending Assessment (NASA), National Health Account and the HIV/AIDS Audit at the level of
MDAs, LGAs and any implementers who access funds in audit period financial audits will be
performed. This approach aims to inform a multi-sectoral HIV perspective.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 59
4.9 HUMAN RESOURCES ANDTECHNICAL NEEDS
Human resources are critical for scaling up and maintaining the National response to HIV.
Considerable progress has been made under NMSF II in relation to addressing the problem of
human resources related to the provision of prevention, care support, treatment and, to a limited
extent, for impact mitigation activities. Despite the increased demand for care and treatment
to support PLHIV there was a sharp decline in the numbers of health staff and other workers.
Specifically, the health workers have declined by 20% from 67
,000 between 1994 and 1995 to
54,245 in 2002, and a further decline of 48,800 is projected by 2015.
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare introduced emergency plan for recruitment of health
workers in order to address the human resources constraints.These problems were also addressed
by key partners including the Clinton Foundation, the Benjamin Mkapa HIV and AIDS Fellows
Programme. While considerable emphasis is placed on front line workers to deliver services, there
is an increased need to deal with the issues of support staff and their activities as well.

5 Governance and Institutional Arrangement
The governance, leadership and management of the HIV response lies with the Government ofTanzania as
outlined in the HIV and AIDS Policy (2001) currently under review. .This Chapter highlights the necessary
organizational arrangements, management structures and institutional coordination arrangements that
ensure attainment of the results outlined in Chapter 4.
This chapter lists the relevant governance, oversight and coordination structures that are relevant to the
NMSF III and the roles and responsibilities of HIV and AIDS stakeholders, both state and non-state. The
issue of monitoring and evaluation, which requires synthesis from a number of different systems into a
single high-level dashboard, is described in the next chapter.
5.1 Governance, Oversight and Coordination Structures
In the United Republic of Tanzania, governance, oversight, and coordination structures represent
central and local government authorities in the performance of executive, legislative and judicial
functions.The implementation of the NMSF III will work in line with the hierarchy of responsibilities
from national to grass root level. A highlight of responsibilities of different stakeholders is presented
below.
5.1.1 Parliament
The Standing Parliamentary Committee responsible for HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse and other sector-
specific committees such as Economic Affairs, Industries, and Trade, Social Services, Community
Development, and Agriculture, Livestock and Water will govern and oversee the implementation of
strategies that impact on the NMSF III. In addition, the Parliament has three oversight committees
which monitor the whole of the public sector: the Public Accounts Committee for the central
government, the Local Government Accounts Committee for the LGAs, and the Parastatal
Organization Accounts Committee for parastatal public authorities. These committees provide
financial accountability for all State and Parastatal institutions that collaborate in the NMSF III.
5.1.2 Cabinet
The Cabinet, which is the highest decision making body in the Executive arm of the government, is
chaired by the President and comprised of the government ministers. Supporting the Cabinet, the
Inter-MinisterialTechnical Committee (IMTC), chaired by the Prime Minister, governs and oversees
all ministries, departments, and agencies with respect to their internal and external collaborative
efforts. Multi-sectoral coordination for all initiatives therefore falls under the jurisdiction of this
Committee, including efforts related to HIV/AIDS.
5.1.3 Prime Minister
The Office is responsible for coordination, oversight and control of the government business.. The
Prime Minister's Office handles all sectoral collaboration efforts including the national response
to HIV and AIDS and chairs the Tanzania Global Fund Coordinating Mechanism (TNCM) which also
addresses other multisectoral related diseases.
CHAPTER FIVE
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 61
5.1.4 Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS)
TACAIDS derives its governance, oversight, and coordination functions from the Act of Parliament
No. 22 of 2001, and is under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office. The Commission
operates under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office; it directs the national response
to HIV and AIDS and oversees the multi-sectoral coordination necessary for integrated action
among state and non-state actors. The Commission is also responsible for strategic leadership,
coordination in the implementation of the NMSF III, advocating, mobilizing and distribution of
funds. Furthermore, the Commission is also responsible for harmonizing information systems to
produce high-level dashboard of the NMSF III indicators, and directing technical working groups to
ensure communication between stakeholders and accountability for results. The implementation
of the NMSF III will follow theThree Ones,
" namely one Coordinating Body which isTACAIDS, one
National Strategy ­ NMSF and one Monitoring and Evaluation Framework .
5.1.5 JointTechnical Working Group for HIV and AIDS (JTWG)
The Joint Technical Working Group is the legal dialogue structure for the MKUKUTA Cluster II, the
platform for HIV and AIDS priority setting, and the reference point for implementation of the NMSF
III. The JTWG is chaired by the Prime Minister's Office and oversees the technical working groups
described in the NMSF III below.
5.1.6 Tanzania National Coordinating Mechanism (TNCM)
The Tanzania National Coordinating Mechanism, a multi-sectoral body currently chaired by the
Prime Minister's Office, was established to govern, oversee, and coordinate resources received
from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. .
5.1.7 Technical Working Committees (TWCs)
The NMSF IIITechnicalWorking Committees (TWCs) are designed to oversee all investments in the
NMSF III Results Framework, receive technical reports from sector-specific TWGs that contribute
to the national response to HIV and AIDS, and produce technical reports for use by state and
non-state institutions. The six (6) TWCs: - Prevention, Care and treatment and support, Impact
mitigation, Enabling Environment, Monitoring and Evaluation and Research, Finance and Audit
These Working Committees will be self-coordinating entities, made up of different constituencies
from government, CSOs, and Development Partners. Each group will coordinate the implementation
of priority strategies in their result areas. These Working Committees will report to the Joint
Thematic Working Group (JTWG) which is designed to oversee all investments in the NMSF III
result areas. There will be HIV and AIDS biennial review to track progress in achieving results; this
forum will also provide policy guidance to TACAIDS on future directions in the national response.
Initiatives to reach the three zeros, reducing HIV incidence, AIDS-related deaths, identifying and
combating stigma and discrimination are cross-cutting for all TWCs.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
62
5.1.8 Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs)
MDAs have roles and responsibilities related to the national response to HIV and AIDS. These
include:-
(i) Identifying factors relevant to the spread of HIV and AIDS in their sector.
(ii) Identifying sectoral strengths, weaknesses and comparative advantages in the national
response to HIV and AID'S.
(iii) Developing sector-specific HIV and AIDS plans, strategies and budgets in line with the NMSF
III.
(iv) Mobilizing resources for sector-specific HIV and AIDS intervention and
(v) Monitoring, Evaluation and research in their sectors.
Despite of the functions and roles of MDAs, the following MDAs have specific roles and
responsibilities in the National Response to the HIV epidemic.
5.1.9 Health and Social Welfare Services
Sectors responsible for health and social welfare will contribute to the Health Sector HIV Strategic
Plan, which forms a crucial component of the NMSF III and represents the largest monetary
investment in the national response to HIV and AIDS. Health facilities, health care workers, and
social welfare officers receive technical direction from the ministry responsible for health and social
welfare and administrative direction from the Prime Minister's Office ­ responsible for Regional
and Local Government (PMO-RALG) through the management of the Regional and District AIDS
Coordinators. Health and social welfare includes HIV and AIDS care, treatment and prevention, as
well as support for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), including children with disabilities.
5.1.10 Education and Community Development
The MDAs responsible for education contribute to the national response to HIV/AIDS through the
provision of basic education, life skills and specialized technical training. Comprehensive sexuality,
gender, and health education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, as well as outside of
school settings, is the primary investment for empowering people living with HIV (PLHIV) to live
without fear of stigma and discrimination. The MDAs responsible for community development
also contribute to this investment area, focusing on the existing social and cultural contexts in
Tanzanian society that make people vulnerable to HIV infection and PLHIV vulnerable to economic
and health deprivations.
5.1.11 Labour and Employment
The MDAs responsible for labour and employment are responsible for ensuring that work places
have supportive policies for PLHIV that are effectively implemented. These include collaborative
efforts with public and private employers as well as institutions safeguarding social security and
disability coverage for PLHIV.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 63
5.1.12 Finance
The MDAs responsible for managing the financing of the national response to HIV and AIDS liaise
with both foreign and domestic funding sources and are charged with raising the allocations and
disbursements of HIV/AIDS funds to the responsible institutions implementing the NMSF III.
5.1.13 President's Office Planning Commission
The Commission is responsible for StrategicThinking of the National Economy, providing advice to
the government on medium and long-term strategies for socio-economic development focusing
on the big picture. The Commission mainly focuses on strategic policy analysis on issues and
problems of great public importance such as HIV and AIDS with a view to proposing appropriate
solution.
5.1.14 Local Government Authorities (LGAs)
Consistent with the government policy on decentralization by devolution, the NMSF III places
increased responsibilities and expectations for the strengthening of the national response to
HIV and AIDS through better planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation at the LGA
level. These LGA's structures include; Village Multi-sectoral AIDS Committees (VMACs), Ward
Multi-sectoral AIDS Committees (WMACs), Council Multi-sectoral AIDS Committees (CMACs),
Council HIV and AIDS Coordinators (CHACs), District AIDS Coordinators (DACs); council and
district commissioners and district consultative committees are also important mechanisms for
planning and implementing HIV programmes. Implementation of the NMSF III requires active
communication and involvement at each of these levels to ensure that results have been achieved
and documented. The regional secretariat has the responsibility of providing policy guidance,
technical assistance, monitoring and evaluation of Local Government Authority HIV and AIDS
interventions. RegionalTACAIDS Coordinators will be responsible for providing coordination role to
all multisectoral HIV and AIDS implementers in the region.
5.1.15 Research and Higher Learning Institutions
Research and Higher Learning Institutions play an important role in the national response to HIV
and AIDS, through technical guidance, research and training f future professionals. Integrating
knowledge about HIV and AIDS, into the wide range of academic programmes should, thus, be
encouraged.
5.1.16 Formal Private Sector
The formal private sector inTanzania is coordinated through the Association ofTanzania Employees
(ATE) in collaboration with Tanzania Private sector Foundation (TPSF). Trade Union Congress of
Tanzania (TUCTA) together with Ministry of Labour formed an umbrella organization creating
a public-private partnership. ATE comprises over 800 companies (small, medium and large
enterprises). With its significant workforce, the private sector should develop interventions and
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
64
tailor their policies to best care for, and provide prevention services for their staff in relation to
HIV and AIDS. In some instances, the nature of an industry increases vulnerabilities to HIV and
AIDS either to their staff, neighbouring communities or the general community. It is therefore of
paramount importance for the private sector to effectively contribute to coordination of the national
response.
5.1.17The Informal Private Sector
The informal private sector permeates all levels of society and cuts across people from all walks
of life. The informal private sector, therefore, can play a valuable role in the national response to
HIV and AIDS. The Tanzania Informal Economy Networks on AIDS Initiative (TIENAI) collaborates
with the informal private sector in all regions in Tanzania and is tasked with developing a strategic
plan in line with the NMSF III.
5.1.18 Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs)
NGOs play multiple roles in the national response to HIV.The roles of these NGOs should include
advocacy, complementing the public sector in delivering community-based services, and playing
the role of a "watchdog" to ensure social accountability and responsibility. They are coordinated
through the National Steering Committee (NSC), with technical assistance in capacity building being
provided by TACAIDS. The NSC oversees networks which include NACOPHA, TAF
, SHIVYAWATA,
NACONGO, TACOSODE, TANGO, FemACT, Policy Forum, Youth Coalition and LESEHA.
5.1.19 Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs)
The Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) in the country are important stakeholders in the national
response. FBOs have also been instrumental in providing spiritual and material support to PLHIV
and those affected by HIV and AIDS, including orphans and widows. They also support a significant
percentage of health care services and contribute extensively to the development of the health
sector. FBOs can mobilize resources and conduct community-based care interventions in a cost-
effective way. Being rooted in community structures, they are favourably positioned to reach
out with the right messages, in line with their moral and ethical commitments; thus, they should
engage significantly with the national response to HIV and AIDS. The coordination of these
FBOs is through the Tanzania AIDS Interfaith forum (TAIFO), representing Christian and Muslim
constituencies.
5.1.20 National Council of People Living with HIV and AIDS (NACOPHA)
PLHIV are the key actors of the national response. They are expected to organize themselves in
associations that can help in the fight against HIV in Tanzania. The NMSF III advocates that PLHIV
groups focus on:
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 65
(i) Protecting the rights of their members.
(ii) Educating the public at large through sharing their life experiences.
(iii) Promoting and participating in the provision of compassionate care to PLHIV.
(iv) Fighting stigma and discrimination at all levels.
(v) Advocating for responsible behaviour among their members.
(vi) Advocating for access to ART.
(vii) Promoting policies and legislation in the interests of their constituencies, particularly their
most vulnerable, least represented members
(viii) Promoting positive prevention.
5.1.21 Development Partners
Development Partners and UN agencies are instrumental players in the national response to HIV
and AIDS through providing the necessary financial resources, technical expertise and material
supplies for addressing the epidemic at all levels. Development partners and UN agencies will
work in close collaboration with government. Key roles and responsibilities include:
· Continually forging partnerships to address emerging or unattended priorities.
· Supporting the modalities of the national response that government partners see as core
challenges facing insufficient resources.
· Coordinating their assistance through a single Development Partner Group for HIV and AIDS
interventions in the country to avoid duplication and ensuring sustainability of services.
· Support the implementation of NMSF III
The roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder will deliberately be aligned and harmonised to
national and inter-sectoral planning budgeting systems and programme reporting cycles. TACAIDS
will ensure that all stakeholders are coordinated and operate within a nationally owned strategy
and aligned results framework, grounded in mutual accountability, gender, equality and human
rights. Significant investments will therefore be made to improve the capacity of stakeholders
involved, both in terms of systems and infrastructure development as well as in the improvement
of skills of their skills.
5.2 Governance and coordination
The implementation arrangement will be guided by this NMSF III with a dichotomy of interventions
between medical and non-medical responses. Medical related responses referred to as Health
sector responses will be coordinated by the National AIDS Control Program of the Ministry of
Health and Social Welfare; while TACAIDS will play two key roles namely (1) Overall coordination
of the multi-sectoral response as stipulated in the Tanzania Commission for AIDS Act (2001) and
(2) Coordinate non-medical interventions. TACAIDS will ensure that all responses are linked and
informed by both the medical and non-medical interventions. All stakeholders are obliged to report
to TACAIDS on the agreed reporting requirements (national HIV and AIDS M & E framework).
TACAIDS will produce and disseminate annual response reports. Administration, accountability
and openness will be guided by standard procedures of good governance.

6 Monitoring, Evaluation and Research
6.1 Monitoring, Evaluation and Research within the NMSF III
This chapter deals with Monitoring and Evaluation of the implementation of interventions
measures the performance of the NMSF based on set indicators. It details systems through
which the effectiveness of coordination will be measured, results tracked and how research will
be designed to inform the ongoing strategy for achieving the three zeros. SMART indicators and
targets must be complemented by complete, timely and verified data. Achieving the necessary
quality of monitoring, evaluation and research for producing these data will require improvements,
strategic coordination and additions to the existing information systems. Program components
in the NMSF III monitoring, evaluation and research should be designed and adapted with the
principles of the NMSF III that is integration, demand creation, protection of human rights, gender
disparities and system strengthening.
6.1.1 Monitoring and Evaluation for the National Multi-sectoral Response to HIV and AIDS
Monitoring and evaluation of the national multi-sectoral response to HIV and AIDS relies on a
variety of systems and data sources routine and periodic, supported and maintained by many
stakeholders. During the course of implementing the NMSF III, these M&E systems will require
ongoing improvement which will include programme monitoring tools, disease surveillance,
household surveys, epidemiological studies and operational research tools. Some M and E
systems will need to be developed, some systems will need to be strengthened, and others will
need to be maintained and integrated for improved inter-operability and fostering linkages between
interventions. All M&E systems will need to produce reliable data that are widely shared among
stakeholders and which translate into improved decision-making.
6.1.2 Research to Inform the National Multi-sectoral Response to HIV and AIDS
During the course of implementing the NMSF III, support for research will be prioritized to enhance
the primary and secondary areas of investment as elaborated in Chapter 4. All sectors should
be challenged to develop, enhance, implement and disseminate research efforts that link to the
NMSF III areas of investment in new and innovative ways.
6.1.3 Health Sector Information Systems
A number of health sector information systems have been developed to support the national
response to HIV and AIDS and progress towards the three zeros. The list is intended to be
necessary but not sufficient, highlighting the key systems already in place.
CHAPTER SIX
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 67
6.1.4 Health Management Information System (HMIS)
The Health Management Information System (HMIS) has been in use in Tanzania since 1993 and
is designed to cover all health programmes at all health facilities (government, private, NGO, and
parastatal). During the course of NMSF III implementation, strengthening of the HMIS will focus on
revisions of new registers, training of users and reporting compliance. Strengthening the linkages
between HIV services and other health facility services will rely on the quality and effectiveness
of the HMIS.
6.1.5 Care andTreatment Centre (CTC) Databases
The Care and Treatment Centre (CTC) databases are part of the HIV Patient Monitoring System
used by Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to track longitudinal patient data and aggregate
information for the national programme. Paper-based patient records are stored at all CTC facilities.
Electronic database records, known as the CTC 2 database, summarize these paper tools, operate
in approximately 40% of all CTCs, and capture around 80% of enrolled patients. There is also
a CTC 3 macro database used by the sector to produce national level reports. The NMSF III
promotes expansion of care and treatment data base system to capture more enrolled patients, as
well as greater linkages between these databases DHIS and other sector systems.
6.1.6 Pharmacy Module
The Pharmacy Module is a computer based access database for ARV and Opportunistic Infection
(OI) drug inventory recording, reconciliation between inventories and dispensing and ledger
records. Furthermore, it reminds about unreconciled inventories and batches approaching expiry.
It also calculates and prints the Integrated Logistics System's Report and Request form, individual
patient records and analysis of dispensing records, matches requests with deliveries, reports drug
trends over time. It runs as a stand-alone system or can be linked with the CTC 2 database. The
NMSF III promotes rollout of this module to improve facilities ability to reduce ARV and OI drugs
stock-outs and expiry for multi-sector approaches.
6.1.7 Integrated Logistics System (ILS)
The Integrated Logistics System (ILS) is used for reporting use of drugs and related medical
supplies, as well as for requesting, re-supply and replacing the vertical supply systems that
previously existed. In order for the NMSF III to fulfil its strategy of reducing stock-outs and expiry
and ensuring patient access to HIV medicines and commodities, health facilities will be encouraged
to adopt and use the ILS.
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18)
68
6.1.8 Electronic Logistics Management Information Software (eLMIS)
The Electronic Logistics Management Information Software is an integrated data warehouse with
a data entry module for all R&R forms, routine logistics data, as well as an analytical and customary
reporting tool to monitor the flow of products from the Medical Stores Department (MSD) central
warehouse, through the zonal warehouses and ultimately to the health service delivery points. It
is designed to help programme managers determine which facilities are under-stocked or over-
stocked, review trends in consumption on a product-by-product basis, estimate procurement
requirements for all products, identify facilities with potential inventory management problems
and plan deliveries to facilities. The NMSF III supports the rollout of the eLMIS to improve MSD's
ability to reduce the stock-out and expiry of HIV medicines and commodities.
6.1.9 Multi-sectoral Information Systems
Multi-sectoral information systems that support the national response to HIV and AIDS include
programmatic and financial management tools, demographic surveys, population surveys,
operational research tools and output data collection systems. These multi-sectoral information
systems will also be used to track the indicators and targets in the NMSF III results framework
and verify overall progress towards the three zeros. The list of available systems is intended to be
necessary but not sufficient as additional systems may be developed to target existing information
gaps.
6.1.10 Tanzania Output Monitoring System for HIV and AIDS (TOMSHA)
Tanzania Output Monitoring System for HIV and AIDS (TOMSHA) was launched in 2004. The
system is designed to capture information on all non-medical HIV and AIDS services that have
been provided by CSOs, MDAs, LGAs and private sectors.The information is reported on quarterly
basis by HIV and AIDS implementers. Financial resources spent on HIV and AIDS interventions
by non medical HIV and AIDS implementers are reported through TOMSHA on annual basis.
HIV and AIDS Prevention Services (e.g., condoms, life skills), HIV Impact Mitigation Services
(e.g., nutrition, school fees, and health commodities), HIV and AIDS training, and HIV and AIDS
programme management are included in the quarterly reports. TOMSHA is one of the routine data
sources that feed into the National Multisectoral M&E System for HIV and AIDS. Strengthening
of TOMSHA during the implementation of NMSF III will focus on increased training of users,
supportive supervision, data quality improvement and reporting compliance among all state and
non-state actors. District cluster survey will be advocated for throughout NMSF III.
6.1.11 Nationally and Regionally Representative Surveys
Periodic, nationally and regionally representative surveys, such as the Tanzania HIV and AIDS
and Malaria Indicator Survey and the Tanzania Demographic Health Survey, condom availability
survey, HIV Public Expenditure Review will continue to be used by the NMSF III to track multi-
TANZANIA THIRD NATIONAL MULTI-SECTORAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR HIV AND AIDS (2013/14 ­ 2017/18) 69
sectoral indicators related to the national response to HIV and AIDS. The NMSF III directs other
sectors, such as agriculture, tourism, mining, transport infrastructure, employment/job creation,
and education to evaluate their HIV and AIDS interventions according to objectives outlined in the
nationally and regionally representative surveys.
6.1.12 Spectrum
Spectrum is a statistical modelling software application developed by UNAIDS to support decision-
making for multi-sectoral programming and policy. The software includes a number of program
area and health system modules. Spectrum estimates in the NMSF III employed the Demographic,
AIDS, and TB/HIV modules. Data sources that fed the Spectrum estimates include the NACP
programme data on ART and PMTCT, TB programme data, THMIS prevalence data and 2002
Census Population data. The NMSF III will use Spectrum to determine and set incidence targets.
6.1.13 EPICOR
EPICOR is the accountancy software used inTanzania's Integrated Financial Management System
(IFMS) and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software used by MSD. The NMSF III supports
the rollout of EPICOR to all councils to strengthen the ability of the councils to budget and effect
funds to support the national response to HIV and AIDS.
6.1.14 PlanRep 3
PlanRep 3 is a computer based Access database used by LGAs. It is used to incorporate the
Strategic Plan Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), revenue projections, funds received
and to track expenditures and implementation. This system imports to and exports from the
EPICOR accounting software and is designed for district aggregations at the regional and national
level for use by PMO-RALG and the Ministry of Finance. The NMSFIII supports the use of Plan
Rep3 to track the planning, expenditure and implementation of multi-sectoral HIV interventions at
the national and LGA levels.
6.1.15 Local Government Monitoring Database (LGMD)
The LGMD collects information on social services delivered by the Local Government Authorities.
It is currently being upgraded to cope with technological advancements. LGMD offers a platform
for integration of HIV and AIDS systems such as TOMSHA. The NMSF III encourages integration
with other M&E systems for improved sustainability and ownership of the information systems
at local government level.

6.1.16 Education Management Information System (EMIS)
EMIS is a system that collects and manages information on the education sector activities. The
system also captures information on training on HIV and AIDS life skills based education. Life skills
education is provided in primary, secondary schools and teachers training colleges. It also provides
information on school attendance among orphans and non orphans.
6.2 Information system gaps
In order to fully track progress towards the three zeros, as enumerated in the indicators in Chapter
4, some current gaps in the available information systems will need to be bridged. In particular,
there are deficits of information in three major areas: numbers of AIDS-related deaths, numbers
of new HIV infections in adults and in children, and monitoring systems of uniquely identified Key
Populations. Data that is available is not powered to represent geographical areas smaller than
regions, such as districts or wards. This seriously limits efforts to target resources appropriately.
In the dissemination of information, there is still a weakness in the systematic dissemination of
M&E information at all levels, including facilities, programs, districts, regions and national bodies.
Routine, systematic and meaningful data use for decision making must be strengthened.
6.2.1 Numbers of New HIV Infections
Tanzania Mainland has been experiencing a generalized mature epidemic for the past three decades.
However, evidence point towards the existence of concentrated sub epidemics within some Key
Populations. In the light of the scale up of coverage for ART among general and key populations,
monitoring of effectiveness of the HIV and AIDS programs using prevalence measurements is
less valuable than using incidence. The NMSF III will promote the adoption of incidence based
measurement towards assessment of incidence beyond the commonly used modelling approaches.
6.2.2 Numbers of AIDS-Related Deaths
Clinical assessments of all deaths with comprehensive HIV co-morbidity records are necessary
to validate the total numbers of AIDS-related deaths in Tanzania. Given the current resource
limitations, practical methods for comprehensive community and facility-based death estimations
are required. The NMSF III encourages research and support in this area of research so as to track
the success of interventions, to measure and reduce the numbers of AIDS-related deaths.
6.2.3 Key Populations
There have been some scattered studies of Key Populations that provide information of the
magnitude of infection among the key population groups; however, these studies were done
on irregular intervals and at small scale. A Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) method was the
commonly employed approach in performing Integrated Biomedical Behavioural Surveillance
(IBBS). Planned, comprehensive and representative approaches to identify the magnitude and
track trends of HIV infection among all key population groups in all relevant areas are needed.

6.3 MID AND ENDTERM REVIEW
Using the NMSF III indicators, both mid- and end-term reviews will be conducted to assess progress
and make course corrections for the future. Low performing/low impact strategic interventions
will be revised; high performing/high impact strategies will be strengthened and expanded. A
full and independent end term evaluation will be undertaken to ascertain the achievements of
set objectives and the targets. The results will form the basis for the formulation of the fourth
generation NMSF
.
Definitive progress made towards achieving zero new infections, zero AIDS related deaths, and
zero stigma and discrimination will itself promote the economic and social development that will
invigorate the national response to HIV and AIDS and result in an AIDS free generation inTanzania.
6.4 Strengthening the M&E System And Research
The key role of the M&E system is to track performance of NMSF III, in order for NMSF III to fulfil
its functions, system strengthening measures are necessary. Priority strategies for strengthening
M&E systems include:
(i) Strengthening the capacity of institutions to carry out monitoring, evaluation, and research
including generation and timely dissemination of accurate data and information for planning,
decision making and programming for the HIV and AIDS priority response at all levels.
(ii) Harmonization and linkage of the monitoring and evaluation systems and creating mechanism
for enforcement of reporting compliance by all implementers of HIV and AIDS interventions
at all levels.
(iii) Strengthening capacity for planned and systematic data collection, analysis and reporting for
Key Populations and vulnerable groups.
(iv) Strengthen consistent data quality assurance through internal and external validation of
results through periodic data auditing.
(v) Plan for incidence studies to complement the current HIV prevalence surveys and surveillance.
(vi) Advocate for sustained adequate budgetary provision and timely release of funds for the
M&E system.
(vii) Build and strengthen capacity for and promote sustainable use of ICT.
(viii) Undertake HIV and AIDS gender auditing of key policies and programmes.
(ix) Ensure databases used for the national HIV and AIDS response are updated and maintained.
(x) Facilitate operationalization of the national HIV and AIDS research agenda
(xi) Adopt new innovations on Research and Monitoring for evidence-informed planning and
decision making to include innovation for treatment and prevention.i
