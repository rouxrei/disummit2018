1. GASTRO INTESTINAL DISEASE CONDITIONS
1.1 Parasitic Diseases
1.1.1 Amoebiasis
Clinical features: Amoebiasis is caused by a protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.
It is usually transmitted from person to person through faecal contamination of food or
hands, but may also be transmitted vial anal sexual contact. Amoebic dysentery occurs
when the parasites invade the intestinal wall and abscesses may develop in the liver or, less
frequently, in the lung or brain as a result of haematogenous spread. Skin lesions may also
occur. Pregnant women and individuals who are malnourished or immunocompromised
are most vulnerable to systemic infection.
Treatment guidelines

1.1.4 Cestodiasis (caused by tapeworms)
Clinical features: Man gets tapeworms by eating raw or undercooked beef infected with
cysticercus bovis, the larval stage of Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) or undercooked food
containing Cystercercus cellulosae, the larval stage of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm). Other less
common cestodes includes Diphyllobohrium latum (poorly cooked fish) and Hymenolepsis nana
(fecael oral contamination by both human and animals especially dogs).

Counselling: Tablets should be chewed thoroughly before washing down with water.
NOTE: Praziquantel has similar efficacy on Tinea infestation
CAUTION: Contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy
1.1.5 Filariasis
Clinical features: Filariasis is a group of disorders produced by infection with
nematodes. These worms invade the lympatics, subcutaneous, and deep tissues producing
reactions ranging from acute inflammation to chronic scarring. In Tanzania the most
important species is Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Onchocerca volvulus and occasionally
Loa loa. The main clinical features are fever, acute lymphadenitis, orchitis, headache and
urticaria in the acute phase. It might precipitate an asthma attack in predisposed individuals.
In chronic infection the main features are elephantiasis of the limbs, scrotal elephantiasis
and hydrocoel. Loa loa causes a typical allergic inflammatory skin lesion (calabar swelling).
Occasionally, the adult worm may be seen crossing the eye subconjunctivally.
Treatment guidelines
Medicine of choice Ivermectin (O)
150mcg/kg (0.15mg/kg) body weight as a single dose. Treat
again at intervals of 6 to 12 months, depending on symptoms
or until the adult worms die out.
Or
Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) (O)
1mg/kg body weight. Increase the dose gradually by 1mg/kg
body at an interval of 3 days to maximum of 6mg/kg body
weight. Duration of treatment is 21 days.
NOTE: Medicines will usually arrest progretion of the clinical features, but will not
reverse them. Surgical interventions may be necessary.
CAUTION: Treatment with DEC should be closely supervised since allergic
reactions are common and may be severe
1.1.6 Giardiasis
Clinical features:
It is an infection of the upper small intestine caused by the flagellate protozoan Giardia
lamblia (or G. intestinalis). Infection with this flagellate is mainly asymptomatic. However
when symptoms occur, they include acute and/or chronic diarrhoea, without blood or pus.
In few cases malabsorption syndrome may occur.
5
Treatment guidelines
Medicine of choice
Adult Metronidazole (O)
2g orally once daily for 3 days
Or
400-500mg orally 8 hourly for five days
10mg/kg body weight 8 hourly for 7 days
Second choice Tinidazole (O)
Adult 2g orally as a single dose
Children 50-75mg/kg body weight as a single dose.
Or
Adult Secnidazole 2g (O) as a single dose
CAUTION
· Patients on metronidazole, Secnidazole and Tinidazole should not take alcohol
· Metronidazole, Secnidazole and Tinidazole are contraindicated in the first
trimester of pregnancy
1.1.7 Strongyloidiasis
Clinical features: It is an intestinal infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. The
intestinal infection is usually asymptomatic but patients may have vague symptoms such as
abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, vomiting, diarrhoea and even epigastric pain. Heavier
infections are more likely to produce symptoms. In immuno compromised patients (e.g
HIV/AIDS and prolonged use of steroids) disseminated infections may occur leading to
enterocolitis and gram negative bacteremia.
Treatment guidelines
Medicine of choice Thiabendazole (O)
Adults: 25mg/kg body weight (max.1.5g) 12 hourly for 3
days. Tablets must be chewed
Children Same as for adults
CAUTION: Not to be given to pregnant women
Thiabendazole treatment in immuno-compromised patients is not always effective, hence
repeated or prolonged courses of thiabendazole from 5-14 days may be required.
OR
Ivermectin 200mg/kg (o) once daily for two days
1.1.8 Typhoid and paratyphoid
Clinical features:
These acute systemic diseases result form infection by Salmonella typhi and S.paratyphi, A
and B respectively. The clinical manifestation and duration of illness vary markedly from
one patient to another. The major clinical features are fever, severe headache, drowsiness
6
and muscle pains (myalgia). The course of paratyphoid tend be to shorter and less severe
compared to typhoid.
Diagnosis
-An elevated white blood cell count
-A blood culture during the first week of the fever can show s.typhi bacteria
-Blood platelet count shows decreased platlets
-An ELISA test on urine may show Vi antigen specific for s.typhi bacteria
Treatment guidelines
Medicine of choice Ciprofloxacin (O)
Adult and children over 15 years 500mg 12 hourly for 10 days
Alternatively Chloramphenicol (O)
Adult 500mg 6 hourly for 14 days

days
Below 1 year 120mg/kg body weight 12 hourly for 14
days
CAUTION: Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in children below 15 years and pregnant
women. Chloramphenicol is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy.
Chloramphenicol may cause aplastic anaemia which is irreversible.
1.2 Schistosomiasis
Clinical features: Schistosomiasis is caused by the fluke schistosome. The common
species found in Tanzania are S. haematobium and S. mansoni. The main clinical feature for
S.haematobium infection is a painless, terminal haematuria. For S. mansoni there may be
abdominal pain and frequent blood stained stool. In chronic form of Schistosoma mansoni,
abdominal distention and vomiting of blood and liver fibrosis (Portal hypertension).
Treatment guidelines
Medicine of choice Praziquantel (O)
40mg ­ 60mg/kg body weight as a single
dose
Or
Three doses of 20mg/kg body weight at an interval of 4 to 6 hours for one day

Up to 2 years 125mg 6 hourly for 5 days
2-8 years 250mg 6 hourly for 5 days
1.4 Diarrhoea
Clinical features: Clinical Features: Diarrhoea is the passage of unusually loose or
watery stools, usually at least three times in 24 hours period. However, it is the consistency
of the stool rather than the number that is most important. Frequent passing of formed
stools is not diarrhoea. Babies fed only Breast milk often pass loose, `pasty' stools, this is
not diarrhoea. Mothers usually know when their children have diarrhoea and may provide
useful working definitions in local situations.
Young children and very old patients are particularly susceptible to the effects of
dehydration due to diarrhoea.
8
1.4.1 Clinical Types of Diarrhoeal diseases.
It is most practical to base treatment of diarrhoea on the clinical types of the illness, which
can easily be determined when a patient is first examined. Laboratory studies are very
useful with the exception of few conditions such as Cholera.
Four clinical types of diarrhoea can be recognized, each reflecting the basic underlying
pathology and altered pathology:
Acute Watery Diarrhoea
· (Including Cholera): which lasts several hours or days:
the main danger is dehydration and malnutrition if feeding is not continued.
Bloody Diarrhoea
· : which is also called Dysentery, the main dangers are
damage of intestinal mucosa, sepsis, and malnutrition. Other complications including
dehydration may also occur.
Persistent Diarrhoea
· : Last for 14 days or longer, the main danger is malnutrition
and serious non-intestinal infections, dehydration may also occur.
Dirrhoea with Severe Malnutrition
· (Marasmus or Kwashiorkor): the main
dangers are severe systemic infection, dehydration, heart failure, vitamin and mineral
deficiency.
The basis for the management of each type is to prevent or treat dangers that each
present.
1.4.2 Management of diarrhoea in children.
Over 90% of deaths from diarrhoea in under-fives would be prevented by:
Continuing breast feeding and other feeding throughout the attack of diarrhoea
·
(prevent malnutrition);
Making sure mothers know when to take the child to a health facility;
·
Correct assessment, treatment and continued feeding at the health facility level (See
·
MoH & SW chart and manual);
Treatment of invasive diarrhoea (bloody stool) with antibiotics;
·
Treating or prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance with ORS ( New osmolarity
·
ORS)
Reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoea and occurrence of future episodes by
·
giving supplemental Zinc
Referring to hospital for investigation and treatment for severe malnutrition and
·
persistent diarrhoea (lasting>14 days)
Low Osmolarity ORS
Low osmolarity ORS (245mmol/lt) has been observed to be more effective than the
Standard ORS in especially preventing dehydration.

20.5 Total osmolarity (mmol/Lt) 245
Zinc
The use of Zinc during diarrhoea has been shown to reduce frequency, stool volume and
recurrence of diarrhoea episode.
All children with diarrhoea should be given Zinc, 10-20mg every
·
day for 10-14 days. Zinc treatment should be continued even after
diarrhoea has stopped
Use of antimicrobial and `antidirrhoeal' drugs
Antimicrobials should not be used routinely. This is because, with few exceptions, it is not
possible to distinguish clinically episodes that might respond to antimicrobials. Moreover,
even for potentially responsive infections, selecting an effective antimicrobial requires
knowledge of the likely sensitivity of the causative agent, information which is usually
unavailable. I addition, use of antimicrobials adds to the cost of treatment, risk adverse
reactions and enhance the development of resistant bacteria.
Antimicrobial are reliably helpful in children with bloody diarrhoea (DYSENTERY). They
are also sometimes indicated in suspected Cholera with severe dehydration, and serious
non-intestinal infections such as pneumonia which may occur concurrently.
Anti-protozoal drugs are rarely indicated
`Antidirrhoeal' drugs and anti-emetics have no practical benefit for all age groups but more
so for children with acute or persistent diarrhoea. Some have dangerous, and sometimes
fatal, side-effect. These drugs should never be given to children below 5 years.
1.4.3 Determining the degree of dehydration and select a treatment plan
Assessment and management are summarized on a chart, included here in a form of
tables. Further information, copies of the Diarrhoea Management Chart and Diarrhoea
10
Training Manual can be obtained from the IMCI Unit of Reproductive and Child Health
Section, Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.
Other signs may be useful in assessing severe dehydration and influence also
management:
Weight loss over a short period;
·
Signs of hypovolemic shock, fast weak pulses, cold extremities, oliguria or anuria;
·
Hyperventilation, deep and fast breathing indicating acidosis.
·
Signs of severe malnutrition

milk.
If the child is not exclusively breastfed give one or more of the following: ORS
solution, food-based fluids (such as soup. plain porridge, .fresh fruit juice, green
coconut juice and yoghurt drinks), or clean water.
It is especially important to give ORS at home when:
The child has been treated with Plan B or Plan C during this visit.
The child cannot return to clinic if the diarrhoea gets worse.
Give Zinc, 10-20mg every day for 10-14 days. Zinc treatment should be continued

even after the diarrhoea has stopped

hospital for IV or NG
treatment
Is IV treatment available
nearby (within 30
minutes)?
Start with IV fluid immediately. If the child can drink, give ORS by
mouth while the drip is set up. Give 100 ml/kg Ringer's Lactate
Solution (or, if not available, normal saline), divided as follows:

1.5 Dysentry:
1.5.1 Bacillary Dysentery
Clinical features:
Bacillary dysentery is caused by bacilli belonging to the Shigella genus with three main
pathogenic groups, namely S.dysenteriae, S.flexneri and S.sonnei. In Tanzania the most
common bacillus is S flexineri. Other less common bacillus inlude Yersinia enterolytica and
Campylobacter species.
However S. dysenteriae tends to cause epidemics. The main clinical features of bacillary
dysentery are diarrhoea, colic abdominal pain and tenesmus. The diarrhoea contains
blood and purulent exudate with little faecal matter. Fever, dehydration and weakness
occur particularly if diarrhoea persists. While the above clinical features are indicative of
bacillary dysentery specific diagnosis depends on culture of faeces. Antibiotics are only
indicated if the patient is very ill with fever.
Management
Rehydration is important if diarrhoea persists and the patient is dehydrated. Refer to
treatment for diarrhoea section 1.4.
Treatment guidelines
Antibiotics are not usually needed. Give only in severe cases in a toxic, febrile patient.
Management of Bloody Diarrhoea (DYSENTERY)
Treatment should include
­ Oral Rehydration Therapy to treat or prevent dehydration and continued frequent
feeding including breastfeeding.
­ Use antimicrobial effective for Shigela. At the moment it is Co-trimoxazole (O)
Bloody diarrhoea persisting after above treatment in adults is presumed to be amoebiasis.
Persistent diarrhoea with Giardia in the stool gives Metronidazole (O)
Young children with bloody diarrhoea should not be routinely treated for amoebiasis

NOTE:
Management of Cholera should be done using National Guidelines for the

Management of Cholera. The use of antibiotic should follow the established
sensitivity.
The principles of management of diarrhoea in adult are the same as in children. As

much as possible the cause for diarrhoea in adult should be established. Special care
should be taken for patients who are immunodeficient e.g. in cases of HIV/AIDS.
However, the most common cause for diarrhoea in adult is food poisoning which
is normally self-limiting.
1.6 Cholera
Clinical features: Cholera is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused by Vibrio cholera
organisms (El Tor and V.cholera). In Tanzania only the El Tor occurs. In its severe form,
clinical features include profuse watery stools (rice water), vomiting, severe dehydration
and muscular cramps. However, in epidemics there are many subclinical or mild cases. In
suspected case notify Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) immediately.
For confirmation at the beginning of an outbreak, take rectal swab or stool specimen,
handle properly and transport carefully to laboratory. Treat on site without referal
wherever possilbe.
Incubation period: Commonly 2-4 days (range 1-7 days)
Management:
Rehydration is the most important step; orally in moderate cases, IV (using ringer

lactate) in more severe cases.
16
Start antibiotics (see below) after the patient is rehydrated and vomiting has stopped,

usually after 4-6 hours. Although the disease is self limiting, an effective antibiotic
will reduce the volume of diarrhoea and shorten the period during which Vibrio
cholera is excreted. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be given to all close contacts in the
same dosage as for treatment.
Start feeding 3-4 hours after oral rehydration begins. Preferably, give antibiotics

(especially Doxycycline) with food to minimize vomiting.
1.6.1 Moderate Dehydration
Give oral rehydration, approximately 75-100ml/kg in the first four hours. Reassess after
four hours; if improved, continue giving ORS, in quantity corresponding to losses (eg after
each stool) or 10 to 20ml/kg. If not improved, treat as severe.
Severe dehydration Give IV fluid Ringer's
Lactate (IV) 200ml/kg immediately as follows
Age below 1 year 100ml/kg over 6 hours
30ml/kg in the first hours
70ml/kg over the next two and half hours.
Age above 1 year 100ml/kg over 3 hours
30ml/kg within half an hour
70ml/kg over the next two and half hours.
Monitor frequently; give ORS in addition to IV fluids as soon as able to drink.
Reassess after 4 hours; if improved, treat as moderate dehydration, if still severe continue
with IV fluids.
Treatment
Adult and child above 12 years Doxycycline (O)
300 mg as a single dose or 5mg/kg single dose
Or
Adult Erythromycin (O) 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days
Children
Or
Adult Co-trimoxazole (O)
Children 48mg/kg/24 hrs in 2 divided doses for 3 days.
Give folic acid (O) 5mg once daily for the duration of the treatment.
NOTE: Doxycycline should not be used in pregnancy and children below 12 years
1.7 Ulcers and related condtions
Clinical features: The term peptic ulcetation and rarely in the ileum adjacent to a
Meckel's diverticulum refers to an ulcer in the lower oesophagus, stomach and duodenum.
In the duodenum ulcers may develop after surgical anastomosis to the stomach. They have
17
in common the participation of acid-pepsin in their pathogenesis. The common ulcers are
duodenal and/or gastric. Peptic ulcer may present in many diferent ways. The commonest
is chronic, episodic pain present in many diferent ways, and may persist for months or
years. However, the ulcer may come to attention as an acute episode with bleeding or
perforation, with little or no previous history. As with duodenal ulcer, epigastric pain is
the commonest symptom of gastric ulcer.
1.7.1 Peptic ulcer general measures
Careful history and examination are essential. Lack of rapid symptomatic response to
antacids makes peptic ulceration an unlikely diagnosis. Symptoms of many unrelated
conditions mimic those of peptic ulcer. Protracted treatment without investigation to
establish the diagnosis is wasteful and potentially harmful.
NOTE:
H
·
2
receptor antagonists should be prescribed only for ulcers proven on endoscopy
or barium meal. Where appropriate, simpler measures indicated below should be
tried first.
"Ulcer diets" are unnecessary. Reduce spices, and avoid foods that exacerbate pain in
1.
individual patients.
Stop smoking and avoid alcohol.
2.
Limit coffee/tea to 1 cup per day. Avoid carbonated drinks.
3.
Medicines to be avoided: All non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS)
4.
aspirin/aspirin compounds, steroids.
Encourage relaxation and regular exercise
5.
Antacids will alleviate symptoms in most cases; when given as shown below:
6.
Magnesium trisilicate compound (O)
2 chewable tablets or 20 ml mixture as necessary up to 6
times daily.
1.7.2 Gastric ulcer
Referral to a specialist is recommended
Consider peptic ulcer general measures (above)
Endoscopic biopsy to exclude malignancy in ALL cases whenever possible.
Cimetidine (O) 400 mg 12 hourly for 6 weeks
or
Ranitidine (O) 150mg twice daily or 300mg at night for 4 to 8 weeks
or
Omeprazole (O) 20mg daily for 8 weeks
or
Famotidine (O)40mg at night for 6 weeks
or
Lansoprazole (O) 30mg once daily for 4 weeks may be continued to 8 weeks
18
1.7.3 Duodenal ulcer
Peptic ulcer general measures (above) should be considered
Initially try antacids every 2 hours
Magnesium trisilicate compound (O)
1-2 chewable tablets or 15 ml mixture 2 hourly
Cimetidine (O) 800mg at night for 4-6 weeks
Or
Ranitidine (O) 150mg twice daily or 300mg at night for 4 to 8 weeks
Or
Famotidine (O) 40mg at night for 6 weeks
Or
Omeprazole 20mg once daily for 4 weeks. In severe and recurrent cases
increase to 40mg daily
Or
Lansoprazole 30mg once daily for 4 weeks
Helicobacter pylori
Patients with persistent or recurrent ulcers should be referred to a specialist for further
evaluation and treatment
Treatment of H. pylori
Omeprazole 40mg once daily + Amoxycillin 500mg 8 hourly + Metronidazole
400mg 8 hourly for 7 days
Or
Lansoprazole 30mg once daily + Clarithromycin 250mg 12 hourly + Tinidazole
500mg once daily for 5 days
Then Lansoprazole 30mg once daily for one month
1.7.4 Non-ulcer Dyspepsia
Symptoms are identical to duodenal ulceration without night exacerbation with normal
endoscopy or barium meal tests.
Explanation and reassurance are important
General measures for peptic ulcers (above) including antacids.
Try milk-free diet for possible lactose intolerance
Try anxiolytic
Diazepam (O) 2.5 mg twice daily for a maximum of 6 weeks
1.7.5 Acute Gastritis
Give antacids as in peptic ulcer. Advise light diet. Alleviate the cause if possible. If it is
not possible to alleviate the cause e.g burns and symptoms are severe, then give:
Cimetidine (O) 400mg 12 hourly for 8 weeks
Omeprazole 20mg once daily for 4 weeks
19
1.7.6 Gastro-enteritis due to bacterial toxicins
Rehydrate with oral fluids in mild cases, and with I.V fluids in more severe cases. Give
antiemetics if necessary (adults only).
Medicine of choice Promethazine (O)
Adult 25-50mg in single or divided doses max. 75mg
Children 1mg/kg/24 in 2-3 divided doses
Or
Promethazine (IM) 25-50mg in single or divided doses
NOTE: Antibiotics are not required except in the special circumstances given below.
Antidiarrhoeals/Antispasmodics should be avoided.
CAUTION: Cimetidine interacts with ARVs.
1.7.7 Ulcerative colitis
Clinical features: Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition of unknown cause in which
there are changes in the structure of the mucosa and submucosa of the wall of the colon,
with widespread inflammation and superficial ulceration. Symptoms vary from diarrhoea
in mild cases to septicaemia, dehydration and malnutrition in severe forms. Diarrhoea,
with blood and mucus in the faeces, is a common sign, although the disease is confined to
the rectum there may be paradoxically constipation.
Treatment guidelines
Refer to a specialist.
Localized disease ­ treat with topical steroids:
Prednisolone (enema) 20mg at night, or same dose via
rectal catheter
CAUTION: Give steroids only in confirmed cases of Ulcerative Colitis. Exclusion of
other forms of infective colitis (especially amoebic) is vital; a therapeutic
trial of metronidazole should be given.
Widespread colitis:
Sulphasalazine (O) 1 gram four times a day for acute
disease, reducing to 500mg four times a day for maintenance
(caution in G6PD deficiency)
Plus
Prednisolone (O) 30-60mg once daily for severe, acute
and extensive disease; reduce gradually according to disease
severity.
Sulphasalazine (O)
Children over 2 years Acute attack use 40-60mg/kg body weight daily
Maintenance dose 20-30mg/kg body weight daily.
20
NOTE: Life long follow up is required.
1.8 Other gastro-intestinal problems
1.8.1 Irritable Bowel syndrome
May present with pain, chronic diarrhoea or constipation. It is important to investigate for
and exclude organic pathology
Reassurance and explanation are essential.
A high fibre diet and eating a healthy diet are the mainstay of treatment.
a) For relief of pain due to abdominal cramps,
Hyoscine butyl bromide (O) 20mg four times a day
b) For treatment of enxiety that may be making symptoms worse
Diazepam (O) 5-10 mg 8 hourly
Give short and infrequent courses only, in order to avoid dependance.
c) If constipation is prominent,
Magnesium trisilicate compound (O) or 20ml mixture 8 hourly
When diarrhoea is a frequent problem
Loperamide (O) may help; 4mg stat, followed by 2mg after each unformed
stool until diarrhoea is controlled.
Explore psycho-social factors in resistant cases.
Consider referral to a clinical psychologist.
Prolonged use of anti-diarrhoeal drugs may exacerbate the condition; therefore avoid use
of the medicines.
1.8.2 Malabsorption syndrome
Correction of electrolyte and nuritional deficiencies is important
1.8.3 Tropical sprue
Clinical features
Tropical sprue is a digestive problem that occurs in the tropics and subtropics, whereby
the fingerlike villi in the small intestine are not able to absorb nutrients properly, especially
vitamin B12 and folic acid. In people with tropical sprue, these villi are flattened, making
absorption difficult. Diarrhea is the main symptom of tropical sprue. People who eat
a lot of fatty foods may get more severe diarrhea than those on diets low in fat. Other
symptoms include cramps, nausea, weight loss, gas and indigestion.
21
Treatment guidelines:
Treatment consists of 3 ­ 6 months of antibiotics and folic acid.
Doxycycline (O) 100mg once daily for 1 month
Plus
Folic acid (O) 5mg once daily for 6 months.
If there is evidence of vitamin B
12
deficiency give vitamin B
12
(hydroxocobalamin
IM)
1mg repeat five times at weekly intervals for replacement.
Maintain if required.
1.8.4 Pernicious Anaemia
Give life- long vitamin B
12
as above every 3 months.
1.8.5 Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is a sudden inflammation of the pancreas whereby enzymes that
normally are released into the digestive tract begin to damage the pancreas itself. Digestion
slows down and becomes painful, heavy acohol use and gall-stones are one of the several
factors known to trigger attacks of acute pancreatitis.
Clinical features:
The most common symptom of acute pancreatitis is upper abdominal pain. Other
symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite and abdominal bloating. In
severe cases, fever, difficulty breathing, weakness and shock may develop.
Treatment
If symptoms are mild
Stop all alcohol consumption
¾
Adopt liquid diet such as broth and soups; such simple foods may allow inflammation
¾
to get better.
Generally the patient with an acute pancreatitis should be hospitalized and treated with
pain relievers and fluids given intravenously (into a vein). If gall-stones are the cause, the
patient will be advised to have them removed.
1.8.6 Chronic pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis is long-term (chronic) inflammation of the pancreas that leads to
permanent damage. The most common cause for such a condition is long-term excessive
alcohol consumption
Clinical features:
The most common symptom is upper abdominal pain that may be accompanied by nausea,
vomiting and loss of appetite. As the disease gets worse and more of the pancreas is
destroyed, pain may actually become less severe. During an attack, the pain often is made
worse by drinking alcohol or eating a large meal high in fats.
Because a damaged pancreas can't produce important digestive enzymes, people with
chronic pancreatitis may develop problems with digesting and absorbing food and nutrients.
This can lead to weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea and greasy, foul-smelling stools.
22
Over time, a damaged pancreas also can fail to produce enough insulin, which results in
diabetes
Treatment
Referral is recommended
Because chronic pancreatitis cannot be cured, direct the treatment towards:
Relieving pain
a. - (medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for mild pain).
In some people, a narcotic pain medication may be needed and in rare cases, surgery
to open blocked ducts or remove part of the pancreas may be done to relieve pain.
Improving food absorption
b. - The patient should be recommended to follow
a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet that also restricts some types of fats. Once
digestive problems are treated, patient will usually gain back weight and diarrhoea
improves. Another way is by giving the patient pancreatic supplements containing
digestive enzymes.
Treating diabetes
c. - Treat Diabetes with careful attention to diet to help keep blood
sugar levels stable. In some people, insulin injections and other diabetic medications
are needed.
1.8.7 Disaccharides deficiency
For example, lactose intolerance
Withdrawal of offending sugar is often sufficient. Lactose deficiency means that milk and
all milk products must be withdrawn.
1.8.8 Peritonitis
Mycobacterium tuberculosis species do also cause peritonitis. Peritonitis may diffuse or
localised clinical features. Abdominal pain, tenderness and gadding are the main features.
Fires, vomiting dehydration and items are also present.
Clinical features: Is inflammation of the peritoneum causative agents are multiple
including bacterial infection secondary to gastrointestinal perforation, ascending infection
from the pelvic organs contamination following penetrating injuries or spontaneous
bacterial infection (especially in children).
Bacterial peritonitis is usually characterized by acute abdominal pain and tenderness,
dehydration, fever, hypotension, nausea and vomiting and tachycardia.Complications
include abscess formation, oliguria and shock.
Chronic peritonitis Refer TB chapter
Treatment guideline
Surgical management following restriction is the mandatory
·
Associated treatment is with antibiotics depending on causative agent
·
Where cause is not known antibiotics of choice are: Ampicillin, Gentamicine
·
and Metronidazole.
23
Medicine of choice Ampicillin (IV) 1g every 6hours for 5-10 days
Plus
Gentamicin (IV) 4 mg/kg/24 hours in 3 divided doses
for 5-10 days.
Metronidazole (IV) or (O) 400-600mg every 8 hours for
5-10 days.
1.8.9 Constipation
In constipation, bowel movements either occur less often than expected or the stool is
hard, dry and difficult to pass. Most of the time, constipation is not related to an illness
or digestive disorder. Instead, the problem is caused by diet, lifestyle, medications or some
other factor that either is hardening the stool or is interfering with the stool's ability to
pass comfortably. Some common triggers of constipation include A diet low in fibre,
inadequate fluid intake, a sedentary lifestyle, ignoring the urge to defecate, travel and
scheduling factors, laxative overuse or a side effect of medication.
Clinical Features
Fewer than three bowel movements per week, small, hard, dry stools that are difficult
or painful to pass, need to strain excessively to have a bowel movement, frequent use of
enemas, laxatives or suppositories
Treatment guidelines
Find out the type of food taken by patient
·
Exclude other organic causes of partial bowel obstruction
·
Encourage high fibre diet, adequate fluid intake
·
Give laxatives as required but avoid chronic use
·
Stimulative laxative
Bisacodyl (O) 5-10mg
Or
Bisacodyl suppository (PR) 10mg at bed-time
Osmotic laxative Magnesium sulphate (O) 4 grams with water before
breakfast, effective within 3 hours.

Adults 15ml, 12 hourly
Children under one year 2.5ml, 12 hourly
Children 1 ­ 5 years 5ml, 12 hourly
Children 5 ­ 10 years 10ml, 12 hourly
1.8.10 Haemorrhoids and other peri-anal conditions
Clinical features: Hemorrhoid disease is due to enlargement or thrombosis of the
veins in the external or internal hemorrhoidal plexus. Common clinical feature is the
24
passage of bright-red blood or blood coating of the stool. There is a feeling of vague anal
discomfort. Thrombosed haemorrhoids can be very painful. Prolapse is a complication.
Treatment guidelines
Treat any identified causative condition
·
Encourage high fibre diet
·
Careful anal hygiene
·
Saline baths
·
Avoid constipation by using stool softener.
·
Medicine of choice Anusol (PR) suppository one or twice a day
Or

ointment (PR) once or twice a day
Paracetamol (O) 500 mg every 6 hours
Second Choice Proctosedyl suppository (PR) or Ointment (PR) once or twice
a day
1.9 Liver Diseases
Liver cirrhosis
This is usually caused by chronic hepatitis and alcohol abuse. It is characterised by
progression and widespread death of liver cells associated with inflammation and fibrosis,
with destruction of the liver architecture.
Clinical features: Include jaundice, hepato megally, asserts, features of increased
oestrogen levels in men, while in women there are features of increased androgen levels.
Hence loss of libido, a testicular atrophy and impotence are common among male cirrhotic.
In women predominant features are breast atrophy, menstrual disturbances including
amenorrhea. Features of portal hypertension like splenomegaly, distended abdominal
wall, vessels and varices bleeding are common. Hepatic encephalopathy is an associated
complication.
Liver fibrosis
S mansoni infection over time leads to liver fibrosis which usually preserves the liver
architecture and liver function. It is a common cause of portal hypertension.
Cholestutic jaundice
Cholestasis may be due to failure of hepatocytes to generate bile flow, to obstruction to
bile flow in the bile ducts in the portal tracts to obstruction to bile flow in the extrahepatic
bile ducts. Intrahepatic causes of cholestasis include viral hepatitis, alcohol, primary
biliary cirrhosis, Hodgikin's lymphoma and pregnancy. Extrahepatic causes which may be
amenable to surgical correction include choledocholithiasis and carcinoma of the biliary
tree. Parasitic infections such as Asceriasis may also cause cholestatic jaundice. The
prominent features include itching, jaundice, dark urine and pale stools.
25
General measures
Identify and treat the cause
·
Surgical correction extruhepatic cholestis
·
Stop the offending medicine
·

CAUTION: Cholestyramine may bind other medicines in the gut (Warfarin) which
should be taken one hour before cholestyramine ingestion
1.9.1 Acute liver failure/Hepatic encephalopathy
General measures
Identify and if possible eliminate the cause (e.g drugs, viral hepatitis, septicaemia,
·
toxins, alcohol or upper G.I bleeding)
Avoid use of all unnecessary drugs including diuretics and sedatives
·
Provide non protein containing high calorie food (2000kCal/day)
·
Medicine treatment
Doxycycline (O) 100mg twice daily through nasogastric tube;
Give laxatives to provoke diarrhoea
Magnesium sulphate (O) 4g with water twice daily, until diarrhoea is
induced or lactose
Carry out high bowel washout once
Give dextrose 10% (IV infusion) 3 litres/day with 2g (26mmol) potassium chloride

added to every litre bag (if renal function is satisfatory)
Check for any infection and treat immediately
·
If signs of bleeding are present give vitamin K (IV) 10mg
·
Add
Fresh Frozen Plasma initially
Add
Platelets if count <20 x 10g/1and patient is still bleeding
If ethanol etiology is suspected give
·
Thiamine (IV) 10mg before dextrose infusion and continue daily for 3 days.
As cites of chronic liver failure
Parecentesis diagnostic should be performed where possible
·
Restrict intake of salt
·
Not more than 1 litre of fluid per day
·
Weight loss should be at 0.5 kg per day. Further reduction of weight per day could lead
·
to hypovolaemia and induce liver failure.
26
For patients not responding to the above measures give
Spironolactone (O) 100mg once daily, increasing to 400mg daily as required.
CAUTION: No potassium supplements with these diuretics.
In case the above measures fails give Frusemide (O) start at 40mg daily increasing
gradually
NOTE: Stop if encephalopathy or uraemia develop
27
2. RESPIRATORY DISEASE CONDITIONS
2.1 Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI)
2.1.1 Pneumonia
Clinical features: Pneumonia is the inflammation of the lung tissue. Pneumonia
can either be primary (to the causing organism) or secondary to pathological damage in
the respiratory system. The common causative organism for bacterial pneumonia are
Streptococcal pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma pneumoia,
viral or parasitic e.g Pneumocystis carinii. The important clinical features are high fever 39°c,
dry or productive cough, central cyanosis, respiratory distress, chest pain and tachypnoea.
2.1.2 ARI in Children
Clinical features for children under five years of age
The important symptoms in children are coughing or difficult breathing. Classification
of pneumonia in children is based on respiratory rate which is either fast breathing or
chest drawing.
Fast breathing is defined as
Respiratory rate>60, age less than 3 months
·
Respiratory rate > 50, age between 3 months and 5 years
·
Chest in drawing is when the lower part of the chest moves in when the child breaths
·
in.

it should however, not be used for infants less than 1 months. Co-trimoxazole is active
against important respiratory pathogens such as S.pneumonie, S.aureus, and H.. influenzae.
Compliance is good as the drug is administered twice daily. It is considerably cheaper
than procaine penicillin, and the drug can be given at home

Management guidelines
In a young infant below 3 months, wheezing is a sign of serious illness REFER
IMMEDIATELY. Wheezing for infants between 3 and 12 months may be due to
bronchiolitics a viral infection, REFER. In Children more than 1 year wheezing may be due
to Asthma-REFER for assessment or give antiasthmatic. If the child is in distress, give a
rapid ­ acting bronchodilator and REFER.
Bronchodilator in Children 1-5 years

2.1.4 Croup
Clinical features: Croup is acute laryngotracheobronchitis which occurs in young
children (usually between 6 months to 3 years of age) and arises as a result of narrowing
of the airway in the region of the larynx. The most common cause is viral infection
(particularly parainfluenza viruses) but may also be due to bacterial infection. The
obstruction is due to inflammation and oedema.
The symptoms include paroxysmal `barking' cough and insipiratory stridor, fever, wheezing
and tachypnoea. Such symptoms usually occur at night. Respiratory failure and pneumonia
are potentially fatal complications.
Treatment guidelines
No stridor at rest, give no antibiotics
·
Stridor at rest or chest in drawing or fast breathing
· REFER IMMEDIATELY to
hospital.

are most susceptible although non-immune adults are also at risk. Diphtheria may be
asymptomatic or symptoms are characterized by grayish-white membrane, composed of
dead cells, fibrin, leucocytes and red blood cells is seen as a results of inflammation due
to multiplying bacteria.

2.1.9 Asthma
This is a chronic inflammation disorder of the airways, characterised by reversible airflow
distruction. There is also inflammation of the bronchial wall.
Clinical features: Asthma is a reversible obstructive airways disease of varying severity.
The symptoms are caused by constriction of bronchial smooth muscle (bronchospasm)
oedema of bronchial mucous membrane and blockage of the smaller bronchi with plug
of mucus. It can be due to identifiable trigger factors or allergens (extrinsic asthma) and is
characterized by dyspnoea, wheezing and tightness of the chest and cough etc.
Management guidelines
Maintenance therapy should be adequate
·
Treatment of acute attacks
·
Avoid heavy exercise
·
NOTE: The management of asthma in children is similar to that in adults. Infants
under 18 months, however, may not respond well to bronchodilator. Details of asthma
medicine treatment in children are given after that of adults below.

2.1.9.1 Chronic asthma in adults
Treatment guidelines
Oral beta 2-stimulant is the drug of first choice. It may be used intermittently as needed
or on a regular basis:
Medicine of choice Salbutamol (O) 2-4mg one to four times a day
Second choice Ephedrine (O) 30mg one to 3 three times a day Or
Aminophylline (O) 15-116mg//kgg/day in 3-4 divided
doses (maximum 1100 mg/day)
NB: Loading doses required: max. 500 mg/day increase after every 3 days to
maintenance.
37
2.1.9.2 Moderate Asthma in adults
If no response or poor response or troublesome side effects on oral treatment then try
beta 2-stimulant in inhaler/aerosol form.
NOTE Ensure competence in inhaler technique before stopping oral preparations
Second Choice If response still not adequate add Beclomethasone 50 1-4 metered
inhalations per dose 3-4 times daily.
CAUTION: Rinse mouth with water after administration
2.1.9.3 Severe Asthma in adults
Same drugs as for moderate asthma, but Add: Prednisolone (O)
2.5 ­ 10mg daily to the above therapy, but try to keep the dose as low
as it remains effective.
Nocturnal asthma
Patients, who get night attacks, should be advised to take their medication on going to bed.
If aminophylline has not been used its addition may be highly beneficial.
Treatment of Acute Asthma attacks in Adults
General measures:
Careful monitoring of the patient's condition is essential to assess severity, and to
·
detect improvement or deterioration. In the absence of blood gas facilities, this
will depend on close assessment of physical signs such as paradox, use of accessory
muscles, colour, mental state, etc.
Humidified oxygen by mask at high concentration (6 litres/min) is important.
·
Consider ventilation in severe cases. A short period (5-10 minutes) of ventilation
·
with ether or halothane may end the attack.
After an acute attack all patients should continue with bronchodilator. A course of
·
high dose prednisolone should be given again with all but the mildest attacks.
Except in mild cases follow up is essential.
·
NOTE: Treatment regimen of all degrees of asthma should include a steroid, preferably
an inhaler formulation
38
Acute Attack in Adults
Medicine Regimens
Adrenaline 1:1000 (SC) 0.5ml (injected subcutaneously). Repeat at 1-2 hour intervals
if necessary. This is useful when asthma is too severe for inhalation.
or
Aminophylline (IV) slow intravenous injection (over 20 minutes) 50-500mg. if patient
has not been taking aminophylline before. If he was on aminophylline give 3mg/kg.
Plus
Prednisolone (O) 30-40 mg once daily for 5 days
Severe Acute Attacks in Adults
If poor response to initial therapy give Adrenaline as above.
Plus
Hydrocortisone (IV) 200 mg as a single dose, further IV doses are needed only, if oral
dosing is not possible. At the same time, start on Prednisolone (O) 40-60 mg once daily
for 5 days. If chest is clear, at this stage steroids can be stopped without prednisolone
tapering of the dose, otherwise reduce by 5 mg/day a maintenance of 5 mg daily until the
patient is reviewed.
Plus
Aminophylline (slow IV) 6 mg/kg over 20 minutes unless the patient was on oral
aminophylline in the past 8 hours, in which case no bolus dose is required.
39
2.1.9.4 Maintenance therapy in children
Table: 13 Asthma Maintenance therapy in Children
SEVERITY OF ASTHMA TREATMENT
Mild intermittent, associate
mainly with respiratory
infections

5 to 12 years: 2 to 4 mg four times a day
>12 years: 4 mg four times a day OR if available
salbutamol inhaler intermittently
Moderate Frequent,
triggered by infection,
allergy, exercise etc.
Continuous treatment
Salbutamol (O/Inhalation) as above
+/-Sodium cromoglycate Inhaler (if available) 1
mg (1 spincap) three to four times a day. Dose may be
increased to a maximum of 2 spincaps six times a day.
Severe persistent wheeze
and/or failure to breath
Add to the Above
Beclamethasone inhaler (50 micrograms/puff)
1 to 2 puffs three to four times a day respond to the
above (always use a spacer)
OR
Prednisolone (O) to 2 mg/kg/day initially, reducing
to dose which controls the asthma; then attempt to give
on alternative days (5 to 10 mg dose).
NOTE: Long term prednisolone in children should be avoided unless there is no
alternative
Acute Attacks in children
The same general measures apply as in adult. Give several puffs of salbutamol metered
inhalation. If poor response
Add Adrenaline 1;1000 (sc) 0.01 ML/KG
OR Aminophylline (slow IV) 4mg/kg over 10 minutes. Do not give if oral
aminophylline was given in the last 8 hours.
Unless response to the above is dramatic and complete, start:-
Prednisolone (O) 2mg/kg/day in divided doses for 3-5 days.
40
Severe Acute Attack in children
If response to the above therapy is inadequate, give
Dextrose 5% IV ­ 100 ml/kg/day

Plus
Hydrocortisone(IV) 2mg/kg every 4 hours
Change to oral therapy when possible; Prednisolone (o) 2mg/kg/day for 5 days
Prophylaxis of asthma
Sodium cromoglycate is used in the prophylactic treatment of asthma including exercise-
induced asthma. It should however, not be used for acute attacks of asthma as it has no
effect on an established asthmatic attack. Sodium cromoglycate should be used regularly.
When withdrawing treatment, the dose should be reduced gradually over a period of one
week. Sodium cromoglycate should be used for at least 4 weeks before it can be proved
as ineffective.

3.7.1 Essential Hypertension
This is also called primary hypertension where systolic pressure raises to 140 ­ 159 mmHg
and/or diastolic pressure of 90 ­ 99 mmHg. The underlying cause of primary hypertension
is not clear.
Clinical features:
High blood pressure can cause symptoms such as headache, dizziness, fatigue, and ringing
in the ears. However it may cause no symptoms at all. High blood pressure can cause
damage to many organs, including the brain, eyes, heart and kidneys, as well as to arteries
throughout the body. If you have high blood pressure that has not been diagnosed, or
that is not being treated adequately, you are at greater risk of having a heart attack, stroke,
kidney failure and blindness.

induction with assisted vaginal delivery of the 2nd stage
Caesarean section indicated for the obstetrical Indication
·
NOTE: Maintain patient airway and secure IV line with a cannular.
Diabetes in Pregnancy (Gestational Diabetes)
Gestational diabetes develops in women during pregnancy because the mother's body is
not able to produce enough insulin. High blood sugar levels in the mother's body are
passed through the placenta to the developing baby. This can cause health problems.
Gestational diabetes usually begins in the second half of pregnancy, and goes away after
the baby is born. The cause of gestational diabetes is unknown. It is thought that the
hormones produced during pregnancy may block the action of insulin.
Diabetic pregnant women require management before and through out pregnancy
If possible they should be managed by specialists.
·
Diabetes should be controlled by insulin and diet and not oral hypoglycaemics
·
Diabetic should be advised to start insulin before conceiving
·
Throughout pregnancy blood sugar should strictly be within the range of 4-6
·
mmol/L
Insulin requirement will increase as pregnancy progresses:
·
Labour if possible should be in a tertiary level hospital
·
When labour is induced give half the usual insulin dose first and start on IV infusion
·
of dextrose 5% at 125 ml per hour.
Labour should be as short as possible
·
Manage the patient on a sliding scale of insulin after delivery.
·

Medicine of choice Hydrocortisone (IV) 250 mg repeat after 24 hours
Second choice Dexamethasone (IV) 12 mg, two doses at an interval of 12 hours
NOTE: If no delivery the course can be repeated after one week
CAUTION: Anaemic patients under Beta stimulants and steroids are inclined to
congestive cardiac failure
3.10 Stimulation
Myometrial stimulants should be used with great care before delivery in highly parous
·
women
Use in obstructed labour should be avoided
·
Oxytocics are indicated for:-
·
augmentation of labour
-
Induction of labour
-
Uterine stimulation after delivery
-
Labour Induction: If no progress of labour is achieved give; Oxytocin (IV infusion)
as follows:
Initially 1 unit then 4 units in 1 litre Normal Saline at 15, 30, 60 drops per minute
·
(dpm) until regular contractions lasting for more than 40 secondly are maintained.
When 4 units are not enough to cause maintained contractions, and it is first pregnancy,
·
the dose can be increased (monitor) to 16, 32 then 64 units a the litre of Normal
Saline each time increasing the delivery rate through 15, 30 and 60 dpm.
Augmentation of Labour
If the membrane is already ruptured and no labour progressing, the steps above
·
should be followed.
Obstructed labour could be the cause of labour failure.
·
3.11 Myometrial Stimulation After Delivery
Excessive bleeding after the third stage of labour is a major cause of maternal mordidity
and mortaility. Post partum haemorrhage is defined as excessive bleeding from the genital
tract after the third stage of labour (more than 500ml)
Major causes are;
-
Uterine atony
-
Tears of the vagina/vulva
-
Rarely rupture of the uterus
-
Bleeding disorder (e.g coagulopathics, DIC)
-
51
In order to prevent the occurance of this condition, active management of the third stage
(ATMSL) is mandatory.
This involves the injection of an oxytocic after the delivery of the foetus followed by
controlled cord traction and uterine massage
Medicine of choice: Oxytocin (IM) 10 I.U.
Ergometrine (M) 0.25 ­ 0.5 mg
Misoprostol 600 microgram (mcg) orally
Misoprostol may cause mild shivering and a slight temperature rise.
Continuation of bleeding requires further investigation such as examination for tears in the
genital tract, bed side clotting time.
Patient may lose significant blood after normal procedure such as episiotomy and assisted
vaginal deliveries.
If bleeding continues recheck for uterine contraction, apply bimanual compression and
administor normal salineand refer (IV).
NOTE: Ergometrine is not preferred as it may cause BP rise in hypertensives patients
and patients with heart disease. It is unstable and may loose potency even within
using time. Examine the ampoule, colour change to yellow liquid may mean it is not
effective.
Store in a cool dark container and should not be used in patients known to be HIV
positive.
3.12 Myometrial Relaxation
This is done to relax the uterus in order to:
Relieve foetal distress immediately prior to caesarean section
·
Stop contraction of uterine in premature labour
·
Prevent uterine rupture
·
Perform external cephalic version
·
Medicine of Choice salbutamol (O) 4 mg every 8 hours
NOTE: B
2
-(eg salbutamol) stimulants should NEVER be used if the patient had an
antepartum haemorrhage
B
2
-stimulants are CONTRA-INDICATED for the following
· With severe cardiac disease
· anaemia in pregnancy
3.13 Termination of Pregnancy
Abortion is illegal in Tanzania except where there is a substantial threat to the woman's
health or life in continuing the pregnancy
52
3.14 Pregnancy and Lactation
General Guidelines
All medicines, if possible, should be avoided during the first trimester
·
Well known drugs and their use in pregnancy and lactation, which have been
·
documented as safe, should be preferred ­ AVOID new drugs
Absence from a list of medicines not to be used in pregnancy or lactation does not
·
guarantee safety (annex products contraindicated in pregnancy and Laction)
During pregnancy and lactation, medicines should be prescribed only if benefit
·
overweighs risk to the foetus or neonate.
3.15 Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases
Clinical features: Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) occurs when there is infection
in the female reproductive organs. The infection can happen as an ascending infection
from the vagina, after delivery (puerperal sepsis), after an abortion (septic abortion)
postmenstrual or after Dilation and Curettage (D&C) operation. The common causative
organisms are Neisseria gonorrhea, Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis. Endogenous
bacteria e.g. gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes like bacteroides, aerobic and anaerobic
streptococci, and E. coli may also cause PID. The condition can either be acute, sub-acute,
chronic or acute. The main clinical features are lower abdominal pain, backache, vomiting,
vaginal discharge, menstrual distrubance, dyspareunia, fever, infertility and tender pelvic
masses. PID predisposes to ectopic pregnancy.
Treatment guidelines
In acute PID: give Intravenous Dextrose 5%
Ciprofloxacin (O) 500mg single dose
Doxycyline (O) 100 mg every 12 hourly for 14 days
And
Metronidazole (O) 400 ­ 500 mg every 8 hours for 10 days
Give an appropriate analgesic depending on the severity of the disease
Acetylsalicylic acid (O) 600 mg every 8 hours preferably after
food
Or
Paracetamol (O) 500mg, 8 hourly
CAUTION: Patients on Metronidazole should not take alcohol
In chronic PID
Give an appropriate analgesic (aspirin or paracetamol) depending on the severity of the
pain.
NOTE: There is no need of antibiotics
53
3.16 Hormonal Contraception
Oral contraceptives (oestrogen ­ progestogen combinaitons) are used primarily for
prevention of conception. May also be used in treatment of dysfunctional uterine
bleeding, dysmenorrhoea or endometriosis.
The goal of therapy in the use of these products for contraception is to provide optional
prevention of pregnancy while minimizing the symptoms and long term risks associated
with excess or deficiency of the oestrogen and progestogen components.
The following questions may be asked to the woman intending to start taking contraceptives
before they are prescribed.
NOTE: Detailed information can be obtained from the Reproductive Health Clinic.
Check List Questions
NOTE: If the answer to All questions is NO the women may be given any oral
contraceptives. If in any of the questions the answer is YES.

3.17 Oral Contraceptives (OCs)
They fall into two major categories:
Combined Oral contraceptives (COCs)
a)
Oestrogen 30 ­ 35 micrograms (as ethinylestradiol) - "Low Dose"
Oestrogen 50 micrograms + progestogen - "High Dose"
Triphasic pills ­ contain phased levels which closely mimic normal cyclical
hormonal acitivity
NOTE:
Lower oestrogen dose pills cause fewer side effects than higher dose pills
·
Mid-cycle spotting in patients on 30 microgram COCs can be managed by
·
changing to 50 microgram COCs
Menstruation on COCs will be regular, light and short
·
Progestogen Only Pills (POPs)
b)
These contain norethisterone, or norethindrone or norgestrel or levonorgestrel. This
type is suitable for lactating mothers or women with mild or moderate hypertension.
Menstrual irregularity is a common side effect.
Management
c)

pregnancy is not desired.
Within 3 days (72 hours) of unprotected sexual intercourse, give
Combined oral Contraceptive 100 microgram ethinyloestradiol and 500 micrograms
levonorgestrel (2 high dose COC tablets)
Or
When this preparation is not available, use 3 tablets each containing 30-35 micrograms
ethinyloetradiol and 150-250 microgram levonorgestrel (3 low dose COC tablets).
Repeat this dose after twelve hours

3.18 Antepartum Haemorrhage (APH)
Clinical features: Bleeding from the birth canal after the 28th week of gestation. Main
forms are placenta praevia and abruptio placenta. Bleeding is painless in placenta praevia.
Bleeding may be visible or concealed in abruptio placenta. Pain and shock in abruption
placenta correspond with degree of separation.
Treatment guidelines
Expectant therapy
Allow bed rest
Blood grouping and cross-matching
Active therapy delivery if foetus viable. If a major placental separation has occurred,
emergency delivery to minimize the possibility of disseminated
Intravascular coagulation
Give blood when indicated
57
3.19 Dysmenorrhoea
Clinical features: Dysmenorrhoea is painful menstruation. Dysmenorrhoea is
present if pain prevents normal acitivity and requires medication. There are 3 types of
dysmenorrhoea:
Primary (no organic cause), Secondary pathological cause e.g. PID and uterine polyposis
and membranous (cast of endometrial cavity shed as a single entity (rare). Typically, in
primary dysmenorrhoea pain occurs on the first day of menses, usually about the time the
flow begins, but it may not be present until the second day. Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea
and headache may occur.
Treatment guidelines
-Allow bed rest
-Analgesics and antispasmodics such as
Hyoscine-butylbromide 20mg 8 hourly (Adult); 10mg 8 hourly (children
6-12 yrs)
Mefenamic acid 500mg every after 8 hours
Ibuprofen 200-600 mg every 8 hours (maximum 2.4 g/day)
or
Acetylsalicylic acid 300-600 mg every 4 hours
or
Diclofenac 25 mg 2-3 times a day
Women with regular complaints can easily detect length of use during their periods (2-3
days usually sufficient). Treat the underlying condition if known
NOTE: For primary dysmenorrhoea patients may be advised to start taking Ibuprofen
one or two days before menses and continue for three to four days during menses to
minimize painful menstruation
3.20 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB)
Abnormal uterine bleeding without pathological lesion in the uterus or lower genital
tract.
Diagnosis after excluding pathology in the uterus, endometrium, cervix vagina and vulva.
The physiology behind is thought to be due to anovulatory cycles and hormonal
imbalance. Other factors that can change bleeding patterns include medications,
excessive weight loss, obesity, stress or illness.
Treatment
(a) Hormonal therapy
Norethisterone (Primolut N) 5mg 12hourly for 10 -14 days
COC (E+P) Combined oral contraception 2-3 cycles.
(b) NSAIDS ­ e.g. Mefenamic acid 500mg every 8 hours to relieve pain
58
3.21 Infertility
Clinical features: This is failure to conceive after one year of regular coitus without
contraception.
Primary infertility: There has never been a history of pregnancy
Secondary infertility: There is a prior history of conception and then failed to conceive.
Treatment guidelines
Emphasis should be paid to see and investigate the couple.
Referral to the specialist for infertility workup and treatment is advised.
Treatment in all cases depends upon correction of the underlying disorder(s) suspected of
causing infertility whether primary or secondary.
59
4. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONDITIONS
4.1 Infections
4.1.1 Prophylaxis of subacute Bacterial Endocarditis
To reduce the risk of bacterial endocarditis, antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to
patients with congenital heart disease; acquired valvular disease (notably rheumatic heart
disease), prosthetic heart valves that undergo any of the following:
Dental procedures
·
Upper respiratory tract surgery, e.g. tonsillectomy
·
Urinary tract instrumentation and surgery
·
Dilatation and Curettage (D & C) in presence of infection
·
Surgery through infected tissues
·
4.1.2 Dental and Upper Respiratory Tract Procedures
Amoxycilin (O)
Adult 3g one hour before operative procedure.
Child 50mg/kg body weight one hour before operative procedure.
For patients allergic to penicillin group, give
Erythromycin (O)
Adults 1.5 g one hour before operative procedure and then give 500
mg six hourly after operation, as long as necessary.
Children 20 mg/kg body weight followed by 10mg/kg body weight
six hourly as long as necessary.
4.1.3 Genital-Urinary procedures
Adult Ampicillin (IV) 1.5-2 g
Plus
Gentamicin (IV) 5mg/kg body weight
Child Ampicillin (IV) 50 mg/kg body weight
Plus
Gentamicin (IV) 1.5-2mg/kg body weight
Both drugs should be given half an hour before the operation begins.
4.1.4 Patient with Prosthetic Valve
Adult Cloxacillin (IV) 2g
Plus
Ampicillin (IV) 2g
Plus
Gentamicin (IV) 5mg/kg body weight
60
Child Cloxacillin (IV) 50 mg/kg body weight
Plus
Ampicillin (IV) 50 mg/kg body weight
Plus
Gentamicin (IV) 1.5-2 mg/kg body weight
The above medicines should be given 30 minutes prior to procedure.
NOTE: Patients with prosthesic valve should be given warfarin in places where
prothrombin time can be determined.
4.2 Rheumatic Heart Disease
Clinical features: Clinical features of the rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are closely
parallel to those of acute rheumatic fever. The main site of pathology is on the valves.
There may be initial stenosis, mixed mitral valve disease (both stenosis and regurgitation),
mitral regurgitation due to chordal shortening, aortic stenosis and incompetence, aortic
regurgitation due to aortic cusp distention, acquired tricuspid valve disease resulting in
either stenosis or regurgitation. The main clinical features of rheumatic heart disease
depend on the valve damaged. For example in pure mitral stenosis there is reduction in
exercise tolerance, breathlessness and palpitation. In the case of aortic regurgitation, when
severe, then the clinical manifestations are those of left ventricular failure.
Treatment guidelines
Prophylaxis to prevent recurrence of rheumatic fever.
A patient with rheumatic heart disease is at risk of getting recurrences of acute rheumatic
fever, which may lead to further rheumatic heart disease manifestations with more valves
being involved or more damage to already affected valves.
Benzathine penicillin 1.2 MU IM every three weeks for life
Treat complications which arise e.g congestive heart failure
Valvular replacement surgery is indicated for the treatment of valvular rheumatic heart
disease
Anticoagulants (warfarin)
These are indicated in patient with prosthetic valves where regular determination of
prothrombine time is possible.
Refer such care for prothrombine determination and warfarin administration.
61
4.2.1 Rheumatic Fever
Treatment of Acute Attack
Benzathine penicillin (IM) as a single dose
Children under 5 years 0.3 MU
Children 5-10 years 0.6 MU
Children above 10 years and adults 1.2.MU

4.2.3 Prophylaxis after Rheumatic Fever
Prophylaxisshouldbegiventoallpatientswithahistoryof rheumaticfeverandtothosewith
heart valve lesions thought to be or rheumatic origin. When possible, prophylaxis should
be continued up to 30 years of age. This may be individualized in some circumstances.
Specific situations always requiring prophylaxis at least to 30 years are
High risk to Streptococcal infections
·
Proved carditis in previous attacks
·
Not more than 5 years since last attack.

NOTE: Prophylaxis is given to prevent recurrence of rheumatic fever, and is not enough
to protect against infective endocarditis. Phenoxymethylpenicillin and Erythromycin are
less effective
62
4.3 Treatment of Acute Arthritis and Carditis
Acetylsalicylic acid (O) 100 mg/kg/24 hrs in 4-6 divided doses for both adults and
children dose to be reduced if tinnitus or other toxic symptoms are observed.
NOTE: Acetylsalicylicacidshouldbecontinueduntilfever,allsignsof jointinflammation
and the ESR have returned to normal, and then reduce gradually over two weeks. If
symptoms recur, full doses should be restarted
In severe carditis with development of increasing heart failure or failure of response to
acetylsalicylic acid, give: Prednisolone (O) 1.5 mg/kg/24 hrs
Gradual reduction and discontinuation of prednisolone may be started after at least 3-4
weeks when there has been a substantial reduction in clinical disease activity; Acetylsalicylic
acid should be continued as above.
NOTE: Heart failure should be managed in the usual way. All patients with carditis
must be kept on strict bed rest until all evidence of active carditis has resolved and the
ESR has returned to normal. Activity should then be gradually increased.
4.4 Hypertension
Clinical features: Hypertension is elevation of blood pressure (B.P) noted on at least
three separate occasions. The disease processes associated with high arterial pressure are the
consequences of the damage caused to the heart or to the arterial wall. The consequences
of the actual level of pressure in a given person will depend not only on the measured
level but also upon certain other `risk' factors such as age, race, sex, glucose intolerance,
cholesterol and smoking habit hypertension. In over 80% of hypertensive patients no
specific cause is detectable, hence the name `primary hypertension.' Hypertension can be
secondary to conditions like coarctation of the aorta, renal disease, endocrine disease, EPH
gestosis and due to the contraceptive pill. Hypertension is symptomless in the majority
of patients. Because hypertension may result in secondary organ damage and reduced life
span it should be evaluated and treated appropriately.
Classification
Hypertension is categorized according to the level of the diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
and systolic as follows:
Diastolic Systolic
Mild hypertension: DBP 90 ­ 99 mm Hg 140-159mm Hg
Moderate hypertension: DBP 100 ­ 109 mm Hg 100-180mmHg
Severe hypertension: DBP 110 mm Hg or above 180mm Hg and above
Lower levels of blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg
are recommended for diabetics
Malignant hypertension:Severe hypertension associated with retinal exudates,
haemorrhages or papilloedema
63
Diagnosis
Blood pressure may rise transiently as a result of stress e.g. when consulting a clinician
(white coat hypertension). Therefore do not diagnose hypertension on the basis of a single
reading but confirm on three separate occasions. Readings should be carefully made and
measured to the nearest 2mm Hg phase V diastolic (disappearance of sounds).
A special large cuff is needed to accurately measure BP in those in whom the
sphygmomanometer bladder does not encircle the upper arm.
Points to Note
Antihypertensive treatment is required for life in truly hypertensive patients
·
Hypertension often has no symptoms: the aim of treatment is to lower the risk of
·
end-organ damage, especially stroke
Compliance is the most important determinant of blood pressure control.
·
Explanation, education and minimizing side-effects of drugs are important
Extra care should be taken with antihypertensive drugs administered to those over
·
60 years of age, because of increased side-effects. Lower doses are needed
Recommended an alternative contraceptive method for women using oestrogen
·
containing oral contraceptive
Evidence of end organ damage, i.e. cardiomegaly, proteinuria or uraemia,
·
retinopathy or evidence of stroke, dictates immediate treatment
Patients should be reviewed every 1-3 months, and more often if necessary
·
Urgent blood pressure reduction may precipitate stroke or blindness. It is only
·
indicated in those patients with hypertensive crisis (see below)
The aim of treatment is to bring the diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg, without
·
unacceptable side effects
Management
Change in Life style
Regular exercises and weight reduction for overweight patients
·
These non-pharmacological measures should be applied in all hypertensive patients:
Dietary management
·
Regular exercise
·
Relaxation to calm down stress
·
Discontinuation of smoking
·
Avoidance of stress
·
4.4.1 Mild Hypertension
Patients with mild hypertension generally can be treated by change in life­style alone but
consider total risk profile of a patient.
In diabetics for examples medical treatment preferably with a converting enzyme
64
inhibitor (captopril, enalapril) is recommended, to protect the kidney.
4.4.2 Moderate/Severe Hypertension
Consider drug therapy only in patients with average DBP over 100 mm Hg checked on at
least 3 occasions over 6 months in spite of changed lifestyle. Drug therapy is indicated
for all those with end organ damage. A step up approach is recommended for choice of
antihypertensive drugs.
Recommended Step-up Care
Step One Bendrofluazide (O) 2.5 ­ 5mg daily
Or
Hydrochlorthiazide (O) 12.5-25 mg once daily.
Step Two Hydrochlorthiazide (O) 25 mg daily
Plus
Methyldopa (O) 250 mg two to three times a day
Or
Propranolol (O) 160-320 mg once daily
Or
Atenolol 50 ­ 100mg once daily
Or
Nifedipine modified release 20-30mg once daily
Step Three Captopril (O) 12.5 ­ 25 mg every 8 hours
4.5 Cardiac failure
Clinical features: It is a state in which an abnormality of cardiac function is responsible
for the failure of the heart to pump sufficient blood to meet tissue requirement.
Dyspnoea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, basal crepitation, congestive
hepatomegaly and peripheral oedema. The principles of therapy are removal of the
precipitating cause, e.g. pneumonia, correction of the underlying problem e.g. hypertension
and control of the congestive heart failure state.
65
NOTE: Constrictive pericarditis, liver and renal failure should be excluded before the
diagnosis of cardiac failure is made.
Precipitation factors should be sought and treated e.g.:
·
Hypertension
·
Infections (especially sub acute bacterial endocarditis) arrhythmias
Electrolyte imbalance
Anaemia
Drug overdose especially digoxin
Pulmonary embolism
Thyrotoxicosis
Daily weights and fluid balance (intake/output should be recorded as a simple
·
measure of response to treatment. Weight loss should not exceed 1 kg per day
Restrict salt in diet
·
Encourage bed rest
·
Check BP daily
·
4.5.1 Mild to Moderate and Severe Chronic Heart/Cardiac Failure
For most patients in sinus rhythm the following regimen is adequate:
Hydrochlorthiazide (O) 25 ­ 50 mg once daily, if necessary increase up to
100mg once daily
NOTE: Salt restriction and bed rest must be encouraged
If no response add Hydralazine (O) 25 mg twice a day increasing to a maximum of 50
mg two to three times a day.
BP should be monitored continuously.
For oedematous and bed ridden patients Heparin (SC) 5000 units 8 hourly day
NOTE: Duration of treatment will depend on response of the patient
4.5.2 Acute Pulmonary Oedema
Prop up in bed Oxygen 40% by mask ( 1-2 litres per minute)
Frusemide (IV) 40 ­ 80 mg once daily
Morphine (IV) 5-10 mg slowly over 1-2 minutes
If no response, recheck your diagnosis, then repeat with higher dose of frusemide. If
patient continues to deteriorate despite repeated doses of Frusemide then Hydralazine
(IV) may be life saving (see dosage under hypertensive crisis). Venescecting 1 unit of
blood may also be helpful.
66
Use and indications for Digoxin
Digoxin toxicity is a very common problem especially in the elderly and pediatric age
groups. Absolute indication is fast atrial fibrillation
To digitalise (check serum potassium levels before starting) indicate recommeded serum
potassium levels
Digoxin (O)
Adults Average dose 500 mcg (0.5mg) stat followed by 125-250 mcg (0.125 ­ 0.25mg)
once daily
Children 10 mcg/kg/24 hours (once daily); However when starting treatment
give this dose 8 hourly in the first 24 hours then continue with one
dose daily.
4.6 Angina Pectoris
Clinical features: Angina pectoris is an episodic clinical syndrome resulting from
transient myocardial ischaemia which is caused by occlusive disease in the coronary arteries
usually secondary to atheromas but occasionally due to syphilitic coronary ostial stenosis,
coronary embolism or congenital abnormalities in the coronary vessels. The presenting
clinical features are a sense of oppression or tightness in the middle of chest which is
induced by exercise and is relieved by rest. The oppression or tightness lasts for a few
minutes. Prinz-metal variety of angina is experienced without exertion.
Change in lifestyle
Minimize risk factors with particular attention to:
Cessation of smoking
·
Weight reduction if obese
·
Control of hypertension
·
Other factors which should be considered and addressed where appropriate include:
high blood cholesterol, stressful lifestyle and excessive alcohol intake. Regular moderate
exercises should be encouraged.
4.6.1 Stable Angina (Infrequent Attacks)
Acetylsalicylic acid (O) 150 mg once daily; (contraindicated in peptic ulcers)
Plus
Glyceryl trinitrate) (sublingual) 500 micrograms as required (no more than 3 tablets
every 15 minutes).
CAUTION: Acetylsalycilic acid (Aspirin) is contraindicated in patients with peptic
ulcers
67
NOTE: Glyceryl trinitrate deteriorates on storage. It is recommended that tablets be
kept in original container and not more than 3 months after opening. Do not leave the
container open for a long time, close immediately after use
Unstable Angina (Frequent Attacks)
Drug of choice: Isosorbide dinitrate (O) 30-120 mg/day in 12 hourly.
If no response, add:
Second line Propranolol (O) 40-80 mg every 8 hours
Or
Atenolol (O) 50 ­ 100 mg once daily
Atenolol is preferred for diabetics and asthmatics. If there is no response to the
combination of nitrates and beta-blockers change to:
Nifedipine (O) 10-20 mg 8 hourly
NOTE: Nifedipine may replace or be cautiously combined with beta-blokers. If pain
continues inspite of above treatment refer patient for further management.
4.7 Myocardial Infarction (MI)
Clinical features: It is ischemic necrosis of the heart muscle due to occlusion of
coronary arteries by thrombus or sub-intimal hemorrhage at the site of atheromatous
narrowing. The cardinal symptom of MI is pain but breathlessness, vomiting and extreme
tiredness and syncope may be present. The pain occurs in the same sites as for angina
pectoris but is usually more severe and lasts longer.
Treatment guidelines
The main immediate needs are for the relief of pain and prevention or treatment of
arrhythmias and other complications
Acetylsalicylic acid 150 to 300mg mg start

5. MALARIA
Clinical features:
Malaria is an acute disease. Patients usually present with fever, chills and profuse sweating.
Howver, an individual with malaria infection may be completely asymptomatic. The clinical
features of malaria vary from mild to severe, according to the species of the parasite
present, the patient's state of immunity, the intensity of the infection and the presence
of accompanying conditions such as malnutrition, anaemia and other diseases. The
above signs and symptoms are not specific for malaria and can be found in other disease
conditions. Therefore, it is always necessary to find out other causes of illness.
Where possible, laboratory investigations are mandatory. Laboratory tests should be
interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings. Urgent laboratory investigations should
be made available for all patients admitted with severe malaria. Since parasite-based
diagnosis is important, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may be an alternative or complement
to microscopy
The management of a patient with malaria will be determined by the clinical presentation
and the diagnosis of either uncomplicated or severe disease.
The objectives of treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:
To provide rapid and long lasting clinical and parasitological cure
·
To reduce morbidity including malaria related anaemia
·
To halt the progression of simple disease into severe and potentially
·
fatal disease
Since the progression towards severe and fatal disease is rapid, especially in children under
five years of age, it is recommended that diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria
should be done within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms.
71
5.1 Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

The first dose should be given as DOT; the second dose should strictly be given after 8
hours; subsequent doses could be given twice daily (morning-evening) in the second and
third day of treatment until completion of 6 doses. Third dose should be given 24hours
after the 1st dose followed by the treatment Internal of 12hours until completion of 6
doses.
NOTE: ALu is not recommended for
Infants below 5kg body weight
· : Malaria is quite uncommon in infants
below 2 months of age (approximately below 5 kg). Since ALu is currently not
recommended for infant below 5kg body weight, quinine is the drug of choice
in this category
First trimester of pregnancy
· : Presently, Artemisinin derivatives cannot be
recommended for treatment of malaria in the first trimester of pregnancy. During
the first trimester of pregnancy quinine should be used as drug of choice for
treatment of uncomplicated malaria. During the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy Artemether-Lumefantrine should be used as drug of choice for treatment
of uncomplicated malaria
Breast feeding mother whose infant is below 5kg body weight:
·
ALU passes through milk. Safe of drug at this stage not known Quinine is drug of
choice at this category.
As far as possible malaria cases should be followed up on the third day if symptoms persist
or immediately if the condition worsens. Health workers should know where they could
refer cases that fail to respond to the recommended drug regimen for further investigations
and appropriate management
72
Where a patient returns between 4 to 14 days after treatment with ALu complaining of
continued symptoms of malaria, non-response should be considered and the following
recommendations followed after a full history and examination:
Where laboratory facilities are not available and malaria is still suspected, treatment
·
with Quinine should be started immediately with strict follow up
Where laboratory facilities are available, a blood smear (and not RDT) should be
·
examined. If parasites are found treatment with Quinine should be started and
treatment failure recorded. If parasites are not found other causes for the symptoms
should be sought and treated accordingly
Second line for uncomplicated malaria: Quinine (O)
Adults 600 mg (salt) 8 hourly for 7 days
Children 10mg/kg (salt) 8 hourly for 7 days
CAUTION: Quinine may have side effects even at this dosage tinnitus, muffled hearing,
sometimes vertigo or dizziness. These side effects disappear a few days after completion
of the course. Hypotension and hypoglycaemia can appear especially if injected rapidly
by the intravenous route.
5.2 Treatment of Complicated Malaria
Severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a medical emergency. Delay in diagnosis and
provision of appropriate treatment may lead to serious complications and even death. In
Tanzania the commonest presentations of severe malaria are severe anaemia and cerebral
malaria.
NOTE: It is important that therapy is initiated without delay at a health facility in
accordance with treatment guidelines
Where facilities for administration of IV quinine are not available
management should include
Early diagnosis of severe malaria based upon a complete history, physical examination
·
and where possible, blood smear/rapid diagnostic test (RDT) examination for
malaria parasites. Taking and reporting of blood smear must not be allowed to delay
treatment unduly.
Provision of pre-referral treatment with intra-muscular quinine and
·
Immediate referral with clinical summary, to the nearest health care facility where
·
resources for the continuing care of patients with severe malaria are available
Quinine Administration (i.m.)
(a)
Dilution of Quinine Dihydrochloride injection (300 mg/ml) for intra-muscular use:
dose of 10 mg of salt/kg bodyweight (not exceeding a maximum dose of 600mg).
Quinine should be diluted four times in water for injection to a concentration of
60 mg/ml. This dilution will minimize the risk of sterile abscess formation. The
calculated dose should be divided into two halves and then administered by deep
intra-muscular injection preferably into the mid anterolateral aspect of the thigh (one
73
injection on each side). Preferably the dose should be calculated for each single patient
according to the body weight. Table below is given for guidance

16 and above 60 and above 2.0 ml 8.0 ml 10.0 ml
Where facilities for administration of IV quinine are available management
should include:
Early diagnosis of severe malaria based upon a complete history, physical examination
·
and blood smear/RDT for malaria parasites. Taking and reporting of blood smear
must not be allowed to delay treatment unduly
Provision of appropriate treatment with intra-venous Quinine
·
Treatment of hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia remains a major problem in the
·
management of severe malaria especially in young children and pregnant women. It
should be deliberately looked for and treated accordingly.
Referral with clinical summary to the nearest hospital when clinical need dictates (e.g.
·
blood transfusion or intensive care)
(b) Quinine (i.v. infusion)
Quinine dose: 10 mg/kg body weight of salt, to be diluted in 5-10 ml/kg body
weight of 5% Dextrose or dextrose-saline and infused over 4 hours and repeated
every 8 hours. Infusions should be discontinued as soon as the patient is able
to take oral medication. Patients should be properly instructed to complete the
7-day treatment with quinine tablets or, alternatively, a full course of ALu may be
administered to complete treatment
74
The drop rate for quinine IV infusion is calculated as follows:
Drop rate per minute = amount of fluid to be infused (in ml) x 20
(drop factor)
time period to be infused (in minutes)

Pulse and blood pressure should be closely monitored during administration
·
Direct I.V injection should NOT be given. Hypoglycaemia may occur after I.V
·
administration of Quinine
75
(c) Non response to Quinine therapy
Patients with Malaria who have not responded to quinine therapy should be given
parenteral Artemether.
Dose: 3.2 mg/kg Stat IM followed by 1.6 mg/kg IM daily for 6 days
General measure for severe malaria treatment
Coma
· (cerebral malaria): maintain airway, nurse on side, exclude other causes of coma
( e.g. hypoglycaemia, bacteria meningitis)
Hyperpyrexia
· : fanning, paracetamol
Convulsions
· : treat as directed in section ... (CNS disorders).
Hypoglycaemia
· : urgent and repeated blood glucose screening;
In children: give 5 mls/kg of 10% dextrose OR 2.5 mls/kg of 25% dextrose as bolus;
·
if 50% dextrose solution is available, it should be diluted to make 25% by adding an
equal volume of water for injection or normal saline
In adults: give 125 mls of 10% dextrose OR 50 mls of 25% dextrose dextrose as
·
bolus
Where dextrose is not available, sugar water should be prepared by mixing 20 gm of
·
sugar (4-level tea spoons) with 200 ml of clean water. 50 ml of this solution is given
ORALLY or by naso-gastric tube if unconscious
Severe anaemia
· : transfusion of packed cells if Hb equal or less than 4 g/dl and/or
signs of heart failure and/or signs of respiratory distress
Acute pulmonary oedema
· : review fluid balance and run patient on " dry side"
but avoiding inadequate perfusion of kidneys; set up Central Venous pressure (CVP)
line, give oxygen. Intubation/ventilation may be necessary
Acute renal failure
· : exclude pre-renal causes, check fluid balance and urinary
sodium. If adequately hydrated (CVP>5cm) try diuretics. Haemodialysis /
haemofiltration should be started early in established renal failure.
5.3 Management of malaria in pregnancy
Malaria is an important cause of morbidity and mortality for the pregnant woman, the
foetus and the newborn. The effects of malaria in pregnancy are related to the malaria
endemicity, with abortion more common in areas of low endemicity and intrauterine
growth retardation more common in areas of high endemicity. Early diagnosis and
effective case management of malaria illness in pregnant women is crucial in preventing
the progression of uncomplicated malaria to severe disease and death.
(a) Management of uncomplicated malaria
During history taking and physical examination, it is particularly important to elicit signs
and symptoms of severe malaria. Whenever malaria is suspected, laboratory confirmation
of malaria parasites should be performed if possible. If laboratory facilities are not
available, treatment should be started on the basis of clinical presentation. If a laboratory
is present, a negative result does not rule out malaria. RDTs have an added value, as they
can be positive even if parasites are hidden in the placenta.
Quinine is safe in pregnancy. In therapeutic doses it does not induce labour. Uterine
contractions and foetal distress with the use of quinine may be attributable to fever and
76
effects of malaria disease.
Presently, Artemisinin derivatives cannot be recommended for treatment of malaria in
the first trimester of pregnancy. However, they should not be withheld if treatment is
considered to be life saving for the mother and other antimalarial are considered to be
unsuitable. Artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) is not recommended during pregnancy in the
first trimester.
During the first trimester of pregnancy quinine should be used as drug of
choice for treatment of uncomplicated malaria.
During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy Artemether-Lumefantrine
should be used as drug of choice for treatment of uncomplicated malaria
(b) Management of severe malaria in pregnancy
Pregnant women infected with malaria are more susceptible to develop severe malaria.
They commonly present with one or more of the following signs/symptoms: high fever,
hyperparasitemia, low blood sugar, severe haemolytic anaemia, cerebral malaria, pulmonary
oedema
The management of severe malaria in pregnant women does not differ from the
management of severe malaria in other adult patients. The drug of choice for treatment
of severe malaria is intravenous quinine. The dose is 10mg quinine dihydrochloride
salt/kg body weight given by infusion in 5% dextrose over four hours, repeated every eight
hours. Infusion should be discontinued as soon as the patient is able to take medication
orally.
The risk of quinine induced hypoglycaemia is greater in pregnant than non-pregnant
women. Blood sugar should be monitored regularly and if falls below 2.5 mmol/L (< 45
mg/dl) give IV 10% or 25% dextrose. While the patient is on IV Quinine treatment, pay
particular attention to the feeding of the patient.
5.4 Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
The drug of choice for IPT is sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine (SP)
SP remains the drug of choice for IPT even though it is no longer the first line drug
for malaria treatment. This is because the aim of IPT is to prevent the worst effects of
infection, rather than to cure a potentially life threatening illness. As such, lower efficacy
antimalaria is acceptable for IPT than for curative purposes. It is particularly important
that drugs used in pregnancy are known to be safe. It is also likely that drugs with a long
half-life are the most effective when used as IPT
The first IPT dose is administered between 20-24 weeks of gestational age. The second
IPT dose should be administered at 28 ­ 32 weeks.
NOTE: IPT should be administered as direct observed treatment (DOT) during an
antenatal care visit
77
6. SKIN DISEASE CONDITIONS
6.1.1 Bacteria Pyrogenic Skin Infection
Clinical features: Bacterial skin infections can be either impetigo, erysipelas or recurrent
boils. All these are caused by either staphylococus alone or together with streptococcus
but rarely streptococus alone. There are other non-bacterial skin infecitions e.g. viral
(warts, herpes simplex, herpes zoster and varicella, kaposis varicelliform eruption), fungal
(candidiasis, ringworm and tinea vesicolor), skin infestations (scabies and pediculosis)
6.1.2 Impetigo
A superficial bacterial infection causing rapidly spereading blisters and pustules. It occurs
commonly in children, usually starting on the face, especially around the mouth or nose.
Often due to Staphylococcus aureus.
Keep infected areas clean and prevent spread to others [(care with towels, clothes, bedding;
change frequently)
Bath affected parts/soak off the crusts with:
Cetrimide or chlorohexidine
Or
Simply with soap and water.
If severe, or systematic symptoms are present (e.g. Pyrexia) add an oral antibiotic.
Systemic
Medicine of Choice Flucloxacillin (O) for 7 ­ 10 days
Adults 250 ­ 500mg four times daily (every 6 hours)
Children 50 ­ 100 mg/kg/24hrs every hours in equal doses.
or
Erythromycin (O) for 7-10 days
Adult 250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours
Children 25-50mg/kg/every 6 hours in a day
Topical Mupirocin ointment 2% 12 hourly
NOTE: For S. aureus erythromycin or Cloxacillin are preferable as they are likely to be
effective against these organisms.
6.1.3 Folliculitis
Superficial infection causing small pustules, each localized around a hair. Deep follicular
inflammation often occurs in the bearded areas of the face (Sycosis barbae).
78
Treatment:
Suspected irritants should be avoided
·
Use of suitable disinfecting and cleansing agents should be encouraged
·
Apropriate anti-infective skin preparations (Neomycin sulphate, gentamicin
·
oxytetracycline cream/ointment or mupirocin ointment 2% can be used.
6.1.3 Furunculosis
Painful boil most frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The skin around becomes
red and hot. Usually resolves itself, but improved by placing frequent hot compresses over
the boil until it breaks.
In a healthy person, review after 2 days, if not improving consider surgical incision and
drainage.
NOTE: For If the boil causes swollen lymph nodes and fever, consider systemic
antibiotics
Drug of Choice Flucloxacillin (O) for 5 ­ 7 days
Or
Second Choice Erythromycin (O) for 5-7 days
Adult: 250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours
Children: 25 ­ 50 mg / kg every after 6 hours
6.1.4 Erysipelas
A superficial cellulitis with lymphatic vessel involvment, due to streptococcal infeciton.
Begins as a small break in the skin or umbilical stump (infants). The area affected has a
growing redness, accompanied by high fever and pains. Responds to oral penicillin.
Medicine of choice Phenoxymethylpenicillin (O) for 5-7 days
Adults: 250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours
Children: 25mg/kg/every 6 hours in a day
NOTE:
Starting with benzylpenicillin injection offers no advantage
·
Erysipelas has tendency to recur in the same area, especially if there are predisposing
·
factors such as chronic lymphatic oedema. In recureent episodes, increase duration
of antibiotic to 10-14 days
Bed rest, elevate the affected part and potassium permanganate or topical Mupirocin
·
ointment 2% compresses may be beneficial
6.1.5 Acute Cellulitis
Inflammation of the deeper, subscutaneous tissue most commonly caused by streptococci
or staphylococci
79
Acute cellulitis should be differentiated from erysipelas as follows:
Raised, sharply demarcated margins from uninvolved skin erysipelas;
·
Indistinct borders ­ acute cellulitis
·
Acute cellulitis can be serious if not treated early (spreads through lymphatics and
bloodstream). Give antibiotics:
Medicine of Choice Flucloxacillin (O) for 5-7 days
Adults: 250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours
Children: 50 - 100mg/kg/every 6 hours in a day
Second Choice Erythromycin (O) for 5-7 days
Adults: 250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours
Children: 25 - 50mg/kg/every 6 hours in a day
6.1.6 Acne
Clinical features: Comedones, papulopustules and eventually nodular lesions on the
face, chest and back.
Management
Seek underlying cause e.g. over use of oils on skin, stress, anticonvulsant drugs etc.
·
Encourage a healthy lifestyle ­ exercise, sunshine, diet, etc
·
Use ordinary soap and water 2-3 times a day (harsh antibacterial cleansers or iodine-
·
containing preparations may aggravate the acne)
In cases with many pustules, use:
Benzoyl peroxide 5% gel topically at night.
In severe cases of nodular acne, treat with oral antibiotics
Doxycycline (O) 100 mg twice daily for one month, then 100 mg once daily.
Continue until condition has improved; this may take 2-4 months. The patient should be
properly counselled.
Alternative for specialist use only: Tretinoin acid (topically) once daily at night.
NOTE: The acne may initially worsen, if too irritant, use every second or third night.
Patients should be encouraged to persist with treatment.
80
6.1.7 Paronychia
Painful red swellings of the nail folds which may be due to bacteria or yeast.
Acute Paronychia
Tenderness and presence of pus indicates the need for systemic antibiotics
Medicine of choice Phenoxymethylpenicillin (O) for 5-7 days
Adults: 250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours
Children: 25mg/kg/every 6 hours in a day
Second choice Flucloxacillin (O) for 5-7 days
Adults: 250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours
Children: 25 - 50mg/kg/every 6 hours in a day
Chronic Paronychia
Often fungal, due to candida. Avoid excessive contact with water, protect from trauma
and apply:
Miconazole or Clotrimazole cream, apply twice daily
Treat secondary infection with antibiotics as above
NOTE: For both acute and chronic paronychia, incision and drainage may be needed
6.2 SKIN FUNGAL INFECTION
6.2.1 Dermatophytosis (Ringworm)
Clinical features: It is a chronic fungal infection of the skin, hair or nails. Clinical
features depend on site of infection and species of infecting fungus. The types of fungus
and site are shown below. Ringworm on hairs is shown by loss of hair, itching and pustules.
On the skin there is a colour change.
Treatment
6.2.2 Corporis (Body Ringworm)
Round, expanding lesions with white, dust-like scales and distinct borders on the body or
face.
Responds to any of the topical antifungal agents
Medicine of choice: Compound benzoic acid (Whitfield ointment) applied
two to three times a day for up to 4 weeks.
81
Second choice: Clotrimazole cream 1% apply thinly three times a day, continue
for 5 to 7 days after clearing of symptoms.
Or
Miconazole cream 2%, apply thinly two to three time a
day. Continue for 5-7 days after clearing of symptoms
6.2.3 Tinea Capitis (Scalp Ringworm)
In this case, the fungus has grown down into the hair follicle. Topical treatment is unlikely
to be effective. Treat with:
Griseofulvin (O) for more than 6 weeks
Adults 500mg once daily
Children 10mg/kg once daily
NOTE: Do not crush the tablet (micronised tablet)
6.2.4 Tinea Vesicolor (Pityriasis Versicolor)
For common fungal infection caused by a yeast. hypopigmented patches of varying size
on the chest, back arms and occasionally neck and face, no systemic treatment is required.
Apply:
Whitfield ointment, miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole cream or ointment
Treat as Tinea corporis for a longer period
Continue with treatment 2 weeks after the systmptons has diappeared.
6.2.5 Tinea Pedis (Athlete's Foot)
This is a very common fungal infection and is often the source of infection at other sites.
Treat any bacterial super infection first:
First choice Whitefield lotion apply for 4 weeks
Second choice If fails to respond,
Miconazole cream 2% or Tolnaftate 1% solution
Or
Clotrimazole cream 1% / powder for 4 weeks
If the above medication not responding use Griseofulvin as above.
ADVISE: Frequent change of socks/footwear, use of cotton socks, thorough drying
between toes after bathing, separating the opposing skin surfaces (e.g. with a piece of
gauze), will prevent infection and speed up healing.
82
6.3 OTHER FUNGAL DISEASE
6.3.1 Candidiasis
Clinical features: It is caused mainly by candida albicans. Clinical feature depend on the
site of infection. Thus the infection of the skin (cutaneous candidiasis) is characteerized
by red, itchy lesions often found in the folds and on the buttocks of babies. Infection of
the nails gives a swollen and painful nail bed which may discharge pus and is made worse
by contact with water. There may be destruction of the nail. Vulvae-vaginal Candidiasis
is common in women on the pill, in pregnancy and diabetics and in people on prolonged
antibiotic courses. Vulvae vaginal candidiasis is characterized by pruritic, curd-like vaginal
discharge, dysuria and dyspareunia. Disseminated Candidiasis, a complication of the
above, presents with fever and toxicity.
Treatment guidelines
(a) Oral Oesophageal fungal infections
Nystatin 100,000 IU apply either as a gargle (in adults) every 8 hours or
as oral suspension in children every 8 hours for 14 days
Or
Miconazole oral gel apply as oral suspension in children every 8 hours
for 5 days or Fluconazole 200mg once daily for 14 days
or

6.3.2 Deep fungal infection
Clinical features: The common clinical entities of deep fungal infecitions are
Nocardiosis and Actinomycosis. Actinomycosis is caused by actinomyces. Its clinical
features depend on the infected site. There is induration in the skin, sinus formation,
pain and when lungs are involved there is cough with purulent sputum. Nocardiasis is
an acute or subacute or chronic infection by nocardia species whose clinical features are
mainly in the lungs and may include pneumonia, fever and a productive cough.

·
6.5 Herpes Simplex
Clinical features: It is an acute infection characterized by superficial vesicles containing
clear fluid in the skin and mucous memberanes, particularly of the buccal area, on the
conjunctive, corneas or genitalia. It is caused by the medium sized Herpes virus homines.
84
The main clinical features are: tingling discomfort or itching, followed by vesicular
formation. Outbreaks of herpes simplex virus encephalitis have been reported.
Treatment guidelines
First Choice Acyclovir 400mg 8 hourly for 7 ­ 10 days
NOTE: Use of systemic Acyclovir is effective when given at the onset of episode
6.6 Herpes Zoster (Shingles)
Clinical features: Due to the resurgence of the varicella-zoster virus, this also causes
chickenpox. Severe burning pain precedes a rash which is vesicular and almost always
unilateral; does not cross the midline. In uncomplicated cases, the rash disppears in 24
weeks, in the haemorrhagic, necrotising form (HIV related) scarring often remains.
Treatment guidelines:

6.8 Other skin diseases
6.8.1 Allergic Contact Dermatitis
Results from an acquired allergy after skin contact with particular chemicals (dyes, perfumes,
rubber, nickel or drugs and skin preparations containing lanolin, iodine, antihistamines,
neomycin, vioform etc). Avoid contact if allergic.
6.8.2 Eczema
(a) Atopic Dermatitis/Eczema: Often a personal or family history of atopic disease
(asthma, hay fever or atopic dermatitis). Cause not known. These persons are also more
susceptible to herpes simplex and vaccinia (but not varicella-zoster).
The clinical form may differ according to age
(b) Infantile aczema ("milk crust") usually appears at 3 months with oozing and
crusting affecting the cheeks, forehead and scalp.
IMPORTANT If generalized exfoliative dermatitis develops, refer to a specialist
(c) Flexural eczema starts at 3-4 years, affecting the flexure surface of elbows, knees
and nape of neck (thickening and lichenificaiton). In adults any part or the whole of the
skin may be affected with intense itching, particularly at night. Over a period of a month,
there may be acute exacerbations and a chronic phase.
Management of Eczema
-Remove any obvious cause e.g. skin irritant or allergen (avoid irritants e.g. soap, wool and
extremes of temperature).
Emulsifying ointment - the equivalent of cream E45, Sofderm cream
Or
Aqueous cream
-Treat itching with an oral antihistamine such as
86
Chlorpheniramine (O) 4 -16mg at night. Not recommended in children under 2
years.
Or
Promethazine (O) 25 mg at night if sleeplessness is a feature.
Or
Cetrizine 10mg once daily for 3 to 5 days
Or
Loratadine (O): Adult (10mg); Children (6 ­ 12 years) ­ 5 mg once daily
NOTE: Avoid Alcohol
Never use topical antihistamines
-Treat any infection (usually bacterial, but occasionally viral). Choice of skin preparations
depends on whether lesions are wet (exudative) or dry/lichenified (thickened skin with
marked skin lines).
If eczema is "weepy", dry first using saline baths or bathe in.:
Potassium permanganate 1:4000 (0.025%) solution once daily for 2-4 days.
-Where large areas are involved give a course of antibiotics for 5-10 days (as for impetigo,
item no. 6.1)
-After the lesions have dried, apply an aqueous cream or zinc oxide preparation for
soothing effect. A topical corticosteroid may be useful in the acute phase. Use the mildest
topical corticosteroid which is effective, starting with:
Hydrocortisone 1% cream for wet, ointment for dry skin. Apply thinly, frequently
initially, then three times a day intermittently to prevent tachyfylaxia
NOTE: Topical corticosteroids often do more harm than good. They may produce
striae, acne lesions and hyper pigmentation. Avoid long term use; never use on weepy
or infected skin. Advise patients NOT to use them as cosmetics
CAUTION: Never use corticosteroid preparations on the face or in children unless
supervised by a specialist. More potent steroid, e.g. betamethasone should only be
prescribed by specialist
-If the skin starts scaling (condition becomes chronic), add/apply a keratolytic preparation
such as:
87
Benzoic acid 6% +Salicylic acid 3% (Whitfield) ointment applied twice daily.
For maintenance, an antipruritic preparation may be useful:
Coal tar ointment 5% applied twice daily.
Salicylic acid 2% and coal tar ointment 5% are to be prepared extemporaneously.
6.8.3 Urticaria
May be allergic, toxic or physical in origin. In many cases the cause is unknown (idiopathic).
Allergic urticaria may be caused by drug (e.g. penicillin), infection, contact with plants,
pollen, insect bites, or foodstuffs (e.g. fish, eggs, citrus fruits, nuts, strawberries, tomatoes).
Physical urticaria may be caused by mechanical irritation, cold heat, sweating.
-If acute (existing for less than 3 months), exclude drug reaction (e.g. penicillin), or
infection (bacterial, viral or fungal).
-Give antihistamine by mouth:
Adult Chlorpheniramine (O) 4-16 mg once at night. Not recommended in
children under 2 years.
Or
Promethazine (O) if sleeplessness is a feature
Adult 25 -50 mg at night
Child 0.1 ­ 0.2 mg/kg 2-4 times a day or 0.5 mg/kg at bedtime
Or
Cetrizine (O) 10mg once daily or Loratadine (O) 10mg once daily
NOTE: Warn about drowsiness. If no improvement after 1 month or chronic problem,
refer. Never use topical antihistamines.
6.8.4 Psoriasis
A condition of the skin characterized by thickening and scaling (the disposition is inherited)
usually symmetrical.
Exclude precipitating factors e.g. alcohol, deficiencies of vitamin B12 or folate, stress,
infections.
To reduce scaling use a keratolytic:
Benzoic acid 6% + Salicylic acid 3% in white soft paraffin applied once daily in the
evening.
Sun exposure to the lesions for half an hour or one hour daily may be of benefit. In
resistant cases
Plus
Coal tar 5% in salicylic acid 2% or zinc oxide ointment or Dithranol 0.1%+Coal tar
5%
88
NOTE: Steroids are discouraged in this condition. If not responding well, refer.
6.8.5 Pellagra
Syndrome caused by deficiency of a variety of specific factors, nicotinic acid being the
most important. Cardinal signs: diarrhea, dermatitis (sites exposed to sun and pressure)
and dementia. Treat both adults and children with:
Nicotinamide (O) 100mg once daily for two weeks or until healing is completed
ADVICE ON DIET: The diet should be rich in protein (meat, groundnuts, beans)
6.8.6 Depigmented skin (Vitiligo)
Leucoderma may be secondary to eczema, psoriasis or other skin condition treat underlying
disease. There is no causal therapy for albinism and vitiligo. Advise yearly examination
for skin cancer; use a sunscreen. An effective and cheap preparation with a sun protection
factor of 15 (SPF=15) is "PABA"
Para-amino-benzoic acid (PABA) 5% cream or lotion applied.
In the morning before going out. Continue application during the day as necessary.
6.8.7 Brucellosis (Undulant fever)
Clinical features: Brucellosis is an infection caused by Brucella organisms. Man gets
infected through exposure to infected tissue and milk or milk products. It is characterized
by seating, weakness, headache, anorexia, fever, malaise, arthralgia, weight loss, pain in the
limbs, back and rigorous. There is splenomegaly, lymphadenorpathy and hepatomegaly.

Clinical features: The rash is characteristically violaceous, shiny papules or plaques on
the wrists, distal arms and sacral area. Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation is common.
Patches of scaling baldness may develop on the scalp leading to permanent hair loss.
Treatment Guidelines Betamethasone cream apply every 8-12 hourly to
remove scales and allay itching.
For severe form system steroid are recommended.
6.8.9 Pruritic papular eruptions (PPE)
This is a skin condition characterised by papular eruptions and itching which may be
quite severe, it is associated with HIV infection. The cause is not known.
(See HIV/AIDS Management manual for details of medicines)

7. SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STI)
7.1 General guidelines
Accurate laboratory-proven diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STI) is not always
possible except in a few health facilities with well equipped functional laboratory services.
For health facilities without laboratory services, one must treat on clinical grounds ie
treat a disease based on suspected causative agents diagnosed clinically or by syndromic
approach. In syndromic approach clinical syndromes are identified followed by syndrome
specific treatment targeting all causative agents which can cause the syndrome. Contact
tracing is encouraged as an important means of preventing further spread. Appropriate
health education should be given at every opportunity.
First line Therapy is recommended when the patient makes his/her first
contact
with the health care facility
Second line therapy is administered when first line therapy has failed and re-
infection has been excluded.
Third line Therapy should only be used when expert attention and adequate
laboratory facilities are available, and where results of treatment can
be monitored.
In order to ensure complete cure, doses LESS than those recommended must NOT be
administered. The use of inadequate doses of antibiotics encourages the growth of
resistant organisms which will then be very difficult to treat.
7.2 Gonorrhoea
Gonococcal and chlamydial infections frequently co-exist. Therefore combined
·
therapy should be given
Treatment guidelines: see under "The Syndromic Treatment of STI".
7.3 Chancroid
Clinical features:
Presence of painful genital ulcers with undermined ragged edges. The base is covered with
dirty purulent exudates and easily bleeds on touch
Treatment guidelines:
First line Co-trimoxazole (O) 960 mg twice daily for 10 days
Second line Erythromycin (O) 500 mg 6 hourly for 10 days
Third line Ciprofloxacin (O) 250 mg 8 hourly for 7 days
91
7.4 Epididymo-Orchitis
Clinical features: An acute severe inflammation of the epididymis, testis and spermatic
cord. Main clinical features include swollen and tender epididymis, severe pain of one or
both testes and reddened edematous scrotum. Causative organisms include filarial worms,
Chlamydia trachmatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli as well as viruses such as which
cause mumps.
Exclude other pathology such as torsion of testis.
Treatment guidelines
First line Doxycycline (O) 100mg 12 hourly for 7 -10 days
Co-trimoxazole 960 mg every 12 hourly for 5 days
Acetylsalicylic acid 600mg every 6 hours until pain is
controlled
Second line Erythromycin (O)
Adult: 500mg every 6 hours for 10 days
Third line Kanamycin (IM) 2g, 1g in each buttock, as a single dose
Plus
Doxycycline (O) 100 mg every 12 hours for 10 days

Clinical features:
Presence of scanty to moderate white mucoid or serious discharge and is often seen 1-3
weeks after sexual intercourse
Treatment Guidelines:
First line: Ciprofloxacin (O) 500mg as a single dose
Doxycycline is added to the first line treatment for urethral
discharge in men and women (See Syndromic treatment flow chart no 7.9.2).
NOTE: If doxycycline is not available, oxytetracycline may be used as an alternative
7.6 Syphilis
Clinical features: Syphilis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the spirochete
treponema pallidum. It can be acquired mainly through sexual intercourse or congenitally
when the mother transfers it to the fetus. The main classification of syphilis is shown
below.
92
Table 18: Classification of Syphilis
Type Stage Clinical features/presentation

Cardiovascular syphilis and neurosyphilis
will give clinical features associated with that
system. Also seen are gumma and osteitis
Treatment guidelines
For primary and secondary syphilis:
·
Benzathine penicillin give 2.4 IU i.m as a single dose given as two injections at
separate sites
If there is penicillin allergy give:
Doxycycline (O) 100mg 12 hourly for 15 days
CAUTION: Doxycline should not be given to pregnant and breast feeding women
and children under 12 years of age
For late Syphilis:
·
Benzathine penicillin give 2.4 IU i.m weekly for 3 weeks.
For congenital syphilis:
·
Up to 2 years of age
Aqueous Benzyl Penicillin 100,000-150,000 IU/kg body weight per day

Or
Erythromycin 7.5- 12.5 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours for 30 days
93
7.7 Genital warts
Clinical features: These are usually caused by papilloma group of viruses infecting
the skin or mucous membrane. The common sites affected by warts include genital region
(condylomata acuminata) hands and legs. The lesions are usually asymptomatic fleshy
growths. In the genital region, lesions are often finger like and increase in number and size
with time. When extensive they may interfere with sexual intercourse and child birth. The
removal of the lesion does not mean cure of the infection. No treatment is completely
satisfactory.
Treatment guidelines:
Carefully apply either 10-25% Podophyllin or Silver Nitrate to the warts, and wash
off in 6 hours, drying thoroughly. Treat every 2-3 days until warts are gone. Contraindicated
in pregnancy/lactation. Do not apply on healthy surrounding skin)
Imiquimod 5% cream applied with a finger at bedtime, left on overnight, 3 times a week
for as long as 16 weeks. (The treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6-10
hours after application).
Surgery may be useful in selected cases to remove the warts.
7.8 Cervical warts
This case should be refered to consultant/expert
Most expert advice against the use of podophyllin for cervical warts. One of the alternative
treatment mentioned above should therefore be used.
Management of Meatal and urethral warts
Accessible meatal warts may be treated with podophyllin or povidone-iodine solution. Great
care is needed to ensure that the treated area is dried before contact with normal, opposing
epithealial surface is allowed.
7.9 Trichomoniasis
Clinical features: It is caused by a flagellate protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis. It causes
inflammation of vagina and cervix in females and inflammation of urethra and prostate
gland in males. Clinical features may or may not occur. When they do they include a frothy
green/yellowish discharge, itchness, erosion of cervix.
Treatment guidelines
Adults Metronidazole give 2gm orally single dose at bed time (avoid alcohol). Give
the same treatment to partner. In pregnancy treatment with metronidazole should be
delayed until after first trimester.
Children 5mg/kg body weight every 8 hours for 7 days

done under local anaesthesia with Lignocaine 2% if procedure proves to be painful).
Irrigation with Hydrogen peroxide 6%
8.1.3 Periodontal conditions
Gingivitis
Inflammatory changes in the gingival develop within a couple of days of undisturbed
bacterial growth on the cervical portion of the tooth surface. Clinically, inflammation
is initially seen as discrete colour and texture changes of the marginal tissue. After 10
to 20 days of plaque accumulation overt gingivitis is established in most individuals,
102
characterized by gingival redness and swelling and increased tendency of the soft tissue to
bleed on gentle probing.
Prevention
Oral hygiene instructions for proper self care

the junctional epithelium and destruction of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone.
Treatment guidelines
Scaling and polishing
Instruction on proper use of toothpicks, dental floss
8.1.4 Infections of the Oral cavity
Infections involving the soft tissue around the jaws are usually of dental origin, developing
from periapical, periodontal or pericoronarial disease. Infections may also be associated
with traumatic injuries, retained dental remnants and pathological lesions such as cysts.

(b) Syphilis
Hutchinson's incisor is abnormal tooth morphology of the permanent maxillary central
incisor inpatients with congenital syphilis. Other teeth may be involved. "Barrel-shaped"
103
is the term often applied to the typical Hutchinson's incisor. It is narrower at the incisal
edge and may have a notch of the incisal edge.
The "Mulberry molar", molar of congenital syphilis is due to marked hyperplasia affecting
the first permanent molar resulting in reduction of the crown form towards occlusal
surface.
Treatment guidelines
See under STI section
(c) Viral-Herpes simplex
Clinical features: When the herpes simplex virus affects the oral mucosa it results in
a herpetic gingivo-stomatitis, usually seen in children between the ages of two and four
years, but in recent years diagnosed in a number of older age groups. After an incubation
period of one week the patient develops fever, swollen submandibular lymph nodes and
a defuse gingivitis.

to anything like dentures, mouthwashes, cosmetics etc.
Treatment guidelines: Remove the cause
8.1.5 Pericoronitis
Clinical features: This is a bacterial infection around the crown of partially erupted or
unerupted wisdom tooth. The gingival abscess occurs as a result of an infection via breach
in the gingival surface. It tends to be localized within the gingivae and is not necessary
associated with a pocket.
Treatment guidelines

8.5 Aphthous ulceration
Aphthous ulcers are painful recurrent mucous membrane ulcerations. Usually affect the
non-keratinized oral mucous membrane. They are divided into two groups, namely minor
aphthous ulcers and major aphthous ulcers.
8.5.1 Minor aphthous ulcers
Painful ulcers on non-keratinized oral mucous membranes; there are one to five small
5mm round or oval shallow ulcers, recur frequently, often cyclically, heal spontaneously in
less than 3 weeks.

ie Prednisolone tablets
Cryosurgery occasionally, to relieve pain and promote healing
8.6 Edentulousnes
The loss of all natural teeth and subsequent resorption of the aviola bone.
Treatment guidelines
Design and construct dental prosthesis according to aesthetic and functional needs.
Materials to be used include: acrylic, porcelain, gold, etc
Malocclusions
Is an occlusal variation that may be functionally harmful or aesthetically objectionable?
Malocclusion can be classified as follows;
Class I
The sagittal arch relationship is normal. The anterior buccal groove of the lower permanent
molar should occlude with the anterior buccal cusp of the upper first permanent molar.
Class II
The lower arch is at least one half a cusp with too far distal to the upper.
107
Class III
The lower arch is at least one half a cusp with too far mesial to the upper.
Treatment guidelines
Removable orthodontic appliances are those designed to be removed by the patient for
routine cleaning. They can be active or passive.
Appliances for active tooth movement fall into two groups
Simple removable appliances which have mechanical a component to move the
1.
teeth
Myofuctional appliances, which harness the forces generated by the orofacial
2.
muscles.
Passive removable appliances may also save two functions:
Retainers used to hold the teeth following active tooth movement
1.
Space maintainers, used to prevent space loss following the extraction of teeth.
2.
8.8 Traumatic injuries to Teeth in Children
May result to loosening, displacement and or loss of teeth, fracture of teeth and or bone,
lacerations and bleeding. The commonest causes are alls (in sports and play) at home or
school and motor accidents. Most affected are teeth upper incisors.
Prevention
Proper design of playing ground observe road traffic rules early orthodontic treatment
Treatment guidelines
Take x-ray picture of affected tooth/teeth. Strict oral hygiene in cases of loosening and
mobility. Use hydrogen peroxide, normal saline, tooth brush. Immobilization of
affected tooth/teeth with arch bar, ss wires, acrylic splints, sutures.
Removal of fracture elements in excessive mobility degree (surgical toilet).
Anti tetanus cover (ATS or TT).
Antibiotic cover I cases of suspected contamination or extensive damage (procaine
penicillin fortified, phenoxymethylpenicillin).
Restoration of aesthetics (composite filling, prosthesis).
Extraction is treatment of choice for traumatized primary teech with mobility and or
displacement.
Referral for maxillofacial management in case of extensive damage to maxillofacial
structures.
8.9 Tumours of the Oral Cavity
Can be traced to originate from tissues of the tooth germ (odontogenic epithelia,
odontogenic connective tissue)
These tumours can be divided into benign and malignant tumours.

tumour being the commonest in the younger patient.
Treatment guidelines
Early detection and referral
Curative treatment comprises of combination chemotherapy
Palliation with cyclophosphamide is of good but temporary benefit.
These should be treated after a definitive histopathological report.
8.10 Shedding of Primary (Milk) Teeth
Phenomenon occurring between aged of 5-12 years. Milk teeth should be left to fall out
by themselves unless otherwise indicated. Parents should be counselled accordingly. Early
loss of primary teeth may lead to crowding of permanent teeth.
8.11 Eruption of Teeth
Starts usually at five months of age. Symptoms associated with it like fever and diarrhoea
are normal and self limiting unless any other causes can be established. The following
conditions usually are associated with tooth eruption should be referred to dental personnel:
eruption cysts, gingival cysts of the newborn, pre/natal teeth.

9. KIDNEY DISEASE CONDITIONS
9.1 Glomerulonephritis
Clinical features: The term glomerulonephritis covers a number of glomerular
reactions in which glomerular inflammation is either a primary reaction or a secondary
consequence of a systemic disorder.
Acute glomerulonephritis occurs most commonly in children and adolescents. Usually it
follows infection with nephrogenic strains of B-haemolytic streptococci. Early treatment
of infected scabies is a good preventive measure. Major clinical features include oedema,
proteinuria and hypoproteinemia. 90% percent of patients make complete and permanent
recovery even if no treatment is given. The remaining 10% may develop chronic
glomerulonephritis followed by renal failure.
Treatment guidelines
Treatment is supportive designed to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance and provide
enough calories until spontaneous recovery of renal function occurs. Treat underlying
cause where applicable. Allow bed rest and control diet and fluid intake
Medicine of choice
Adult Amoxycillin (O) 500 mg 8 hourly for 5 - 7 days

pelvis. Infections usually occur by the ascending route. It is commonly caused by gram-
negative organisms like E. Coli. Clinical features include: chills, fever, flank pain and
vomiting.
General Management
Where facilities are available, do culture and sensitivity test to determine the antibiotic
choice.
Give oral fluids or IV depending on severity of the case to increase urine output.

the of the duration of course.
b) A shorter course of up to 3 days may be enough for uncomplicated infections in
women. A duration of 7 to 10 days may be necessary for men and children and for
recurrent attacks or previous pyelonephritis in women.
9.3 Nephrotic Syndrome
Clinical features: It is a syndrome charactirised by massive proteinuria (> 3.5 g/24
hours), hypoalbuminemia (<30 g/litre) and massive oedema. Hyperlipidaemia and
increased congulability of blood are important features.
Nephrotic Syndrome may be due to primary glomerular disease or secondary to other
diseases, systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and infections e.g. Hepatitis B, HIV
and malaria

meatus and/or the middle ear. The clinical features are itching and pain in the dry, scaling
ear canal. There may be a water or purulent discharge and intermittent deafness. Pain
may become extreme when the ear canal becomes completely occluded with edematous
skin and debris. In otitis media (acute or chronic) the clinical features are ear pain, a
sensation of fullness in the ear and hearing loss, aural discharge. Onset usually follows an
upper respiratory tract infection. Chronic otitis media is associated with perforation of

10.2 Acute Rhinitis and Sinusitis
Clinical features: Rhinitis is caused by a variety of viruses. Acute sinusitis starts with
obstruction of the ostium, followed by reduced ventilation, retention of discharge and
bacteria multiplication. If the ostium is blocked for a longer period, sinus empyema may
occur. The bacteria most often causing purulent sinusitis are pneumococci and Haemophillus
influenza which in some studies are shown to be equally common. Maraxella catarrhalis and
group A streptococci also occur. In sinusitis of dental origin, anaerobic bacteria are often
found.
Definition
Acute rhinitis: A viral inflammatory condition in the nasal mucous membrane, usually
part of a more wide-spread infection of the upper respiratory tract.
Acute purulent sinusitis: Bacterial infection with pus accumulation in one or more
of the sinuses
Acute serous sinusitis: Aninflammationinoneormoresinuseswithfluidaccumulation
but without pus formation.

12. TUBERCULOSIS AND LEPROSY
12.1 TUBERCULOSIS
Clinical features: Tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial infection, debilitating disease caused
by Mycobacteria, the most common of which is Mycobactrium tuberculosis. Less frequently,
it can be caused by Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium africanus. The clinical picture is
quite variable and depends on the specific organ affected by the disease. The disease can
take the following forms: Pulmonary, meningitis, lymphadenitis, osteoarticular, potts
disease, intestinal, renal, peritoneal and cutaneous. Due to the association of TB and HIV
infection, the prevalence of TB is increasing and patients are more seriously ill than before.
Tuberculosis is a public health problem and all cases must be notified to the Ministry of
Health and Social Welfare.
12.1.1 Control of Tuberculosis
Important key points are:
Treatment should be short, effective and provided free of charge
·
TB services should reach all areas, integrated in Primary Health Care (PHC) system
·
and ensure widespread use of BCG vaccination and case finding (especially sputum
positive patients)
Prevention
BCG vaccination is given at birth or at first contact with the child after birth. It is given
intradermally on the right upper arm, above the insertion of the deltoid muscle.
NOTE: The batch number of the vaccine and the date of manufacture must be recorded
on the antenatal card. Dosages are recommended by EPI Programme. BCG should be
given to all babies.
Non-healingulcersaftervaccinationwithBCG(upto8weeks)orregionallymphadenopathy
can be treated with:
Isoniazid (O) 5 mg/kg body weight daily for 6 months and needle aspiration in case of
an abscess.
12.1.2 Case Management
Diagnosis
Smear microscopy remains the most important diagnostic tool. Histopathology and
radiography are also helpful, particularly in those patients who do not produce sputum.
Sputum
Each patient should have direct smear microscopy (DSM) on 3 sputum specimens for
diagnosis. DSM should be repeated at the end of the intensive phase to confirm sputum
conversion.
125
Sputum of TB patients MUST be sent or taken to the TB Reference Laboratory when:
Sputum conversion to negative has not taken place
·
There is concern that the patient has developed drug resistance
·
Culture and sensitivities are required.
·
Chest X-rays
This has to be done upon:
Admission for diagnosis
·
Completion of outpatient treatment
·
NOTE: To reduce the rate of exposure of the patients, any other films can be taken
only where specifically indicated. An X-ray at the end of the intensive phase is not likely
to provide any additional benefit.
126
The diagnosis of TB in children can be very difficult owing to the wide range of symptoms.
Sputum cannot often be obtained from children and in any case it is often negative even
on culture. Symptoms in children are not typical. The diagnosis should therefore be based
on clinical findings, family history of contact with a smear positive case, X-ray examination
and tuberculin testing, culture (if available) and non-response to broad spectrum antibiotic
treatment. A score chat below can help to reach the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Older
children who are able to cough up sputum should go through the same assessment as
adults using smear microscopy as the "gold standard".

Tuberculin Testing
The tuberculosis skin test is valuable as a diagnostic tool in young children. In a child who did not
receive a BCG vaccine an induration of 10mm or more is interpreted as positive. If the child did
receive a BCG, the induration should be a t least 15mm to be positive.
A positive result may indicate:
Active infection (especially when strongly positive)

12.1.3.4 Treatment guidelines Category IV; Chronic patients
No regimen available yet in Tanzania
These are patients who remain or become sputum smear positive after completing fully
supervised re-treatment regimen. It is important to identify patients with Multi Drug
Resistant (MDR) TB among chronic patients. Not every chronic patient is MDR-TB
case. Many of these patients, although persistently smear positive, may still harbour
bacilli partially or fully sensitive to the common anti-TB drugs.
A "chronic" TB patient with unknown susceptibility pattern should always
first submit sputum samples for drug susceptibility testing to the central TB reference
laboratory before any further actions taken.
12.1.3.5 Treatment in special cases
Pregnancy Always ask woman if is pregnant before commencing treatment. Most
anti-TB drugs are safe during pregnancies except streptomycin, which causes permanent
deafness in the foetus therefore it should be avoided during pregnancy.
Breastfeeding Full TB treatment is safe and is the best way to prevent tuberculosis
in the baby. Mother and child can stay together for the entire duration of treatment. In
mothers with pulmonary tuberculosis, the baby should receive INH preventive treatment
(5mg/kg) for 6 months followed by BCG vaccination.
Oral contraceptives Rifampicin interacts with oral contraceptives and reduces the
efficacy of this contraception. Women using oral contraceptives should be advised to use
pills with a higher dose of oestrogen (50mcg) or change to another method.
Liver disease Most anti-TB drugs can cause liver damage. In case a patient develops
jaundice, treatment should be stopped and restarted as soon as the jaundice resolves.
In severely ill patients start streptomycin and ethambutol only. If the patient improves
follow with a gradual step-up introduction of Isoniazid followed by Rifampicin until full
131
dose. Monitor liver functions and clinical picture. If the condition deteriorates stop the
drug which was last added.
Patients with established chronic liver-disease should not receive Pyrazianamide. The
treatement given is 2 RHE/6EH for Category I and III patients and 2 SRHE/6RHE for
Category II patients.
Renal failure Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide are almost entirely excreted
by the liver and therefore safe to use. Streptomycin and Ethambutol are excreted by the
kidneys and should either be avoided or given in a reduced dose. The safest regimen
for patients with renal failure is 2 RHZ/4 RH combined with pyridoxine to prevent
Isoniazide induced peripheral neuropathy.
HIV There is a danger of interaction between Rifampicin and protease inhibitors in
HIV positive patients receiving antiretoviral (ARV) treatments. Rifampicin stimulates
the activity of the liver enzyme system, which metabolises protease inhibitors (PI) and
Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NsRTIs). This can lead to decreased blood
levels of PIs and NsRTIs. Of the NsRTIs the concentration of Nevirapine is significant
redeced and hence Nevirapine and Rifampicine should not be used concomintantly.
On other hand PIs enhance the liver enzyme system which influences the blood levels
of rifampicin resulting in ineffective TB treatment or drug toxicity. NsRTIs can cause
peripheral neuropathy, which can result in an added toxicity caused by Isoniazid.
12.1.3.6 The role of adjuvant steroid therapy
Steroid therapy given in additional to anti-TB treatment is beneficial in tuberculosis
meningitis, pleural TB with large effusion and TB pericarditis.
The recommended dosage in TB meningitis and TB pericarditis is 40-60mg/daily for
1 ­ 4 weeks, gradually decreasing the dosage over several weeks.
Other less frequent conditions, which can benefit from steroid treatment, are:
TB laryngitis with airway obstruction
o
Massive lymphadenopathy with signs of obstruction of e.g airway
o
TB of renal tract to prevent uretic scarring
o
Tb of adrenal glands causing hypo-adrenalism
o
Severe hypersensitivity reaction to anti-TB drugs
o
Although steroids are immunosuppressant they can be used in HIV positive patients as the
overall benefit of steroids, in the context of above conditions, outweighs the risk of other
opportunistic infections.
12.2 LEPROSY
Clinical features: It is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium
leprae, an acid and alcohol fast bacillus that has a very slow multiplication. Leprosy is the
commonest cause of peripheral neuritis in the world. The major clinical features therefore
include hypopigmented anaesthetic macula or nodular and erythematous skin lesions and
nerve thickening. It is classified into five different levels according to nuclear of bacilli
found in the lesion.
132
12.2.1 General Information about Leprosy
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It mainly affects the
skin, the peripheral nerves and the mucous membranes. It is a disease mainly of human
beings, which affects people of all races, all ages and both sexes.
Patients harbouring many bacilli in their bodies, the multi bacillary patients, are the main
sources of infection. If not treated, they spread the disease in the community and infect
others through coughing and sneezing (droplet infection). These infectious patients
represent only about 25% of the registered leprosy patients in Tanzania. The other
75% of patients with few leprosy bacilli, the paucibacillary patients are less infectious.
Skin contact with leprosy patients is no longer considered to be an important means of
transmission.
The different manifestation of leprosy are due to differences in the degree of resistance
(immunity) of the human body and not due to different kinds of bacilli.
The majority of people (about 85%) have a strong resistance to M. Leprae that even when
infected they do not develop the disease. They are immune. About 75% of children who
get infected with leprosy bacilli have such a high resistance that they overcome the disease
themselves, without treatment, at very early stage. People who have a fairly high but
incomplete immunity to leprosy bacilli will develop paucibacillary leprosy.
There are only very few people in the community (5-10%) whose immunity to M. Leprae is
naturally very low. When somebody from this group of people is infected by M.Leprae, the
bacilli may multiply freely and attain large numbers causing multi-bacillary leprosy.
12.2.2 When Leprosy should be suspected
Patients should be suspected of having leprosy when they show one or more of the
following signs or symptoms:
One or more pale or reddish, hypo-pigmented patch(es) on the skin with or without
·
loss of sensation
Painless swellings or lumps in the face and/or earlobes
·
Enlarged and/or tender nerves
·
Burning sensations in the skin
·
Numbness or tingling of the feet and/or hands
·
Weakness of eyelids, hands and/or feet
·
Painless wounds or burns on the hands and/or feet
·
Such patients need to be examined by trained health worker.
12.2.3 Diagnosis of Leprosy
The diagnosis of leprosy must be based on the history of the symptoms and careful clinical
examination of the person for signs of leprosy. Only in rare instances a laboratory and
other investigation may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of leprosy.If one is not sure of
dignosis,the suspect should be seen by the DTLC or other personel trained in leprosy.
133
History taking
Proper history taking and collection of certain information on the patient are very
important for understanding the patient's situation and for tracing a lost patient.
The following must be obtained:
General information: all three names, sex, year of birth,occupation, full address
·
including the name of of village/street leader and distance from home to clinic.
Main complaints, including date of onset, site of first lesions,subsequent changes and
·
development of the disease,previous treatment received.
Information regarding other leprosy cases in patient's household.
·
Physical examination
Physical examination should always be carried out with adequate light available and with
enough privacy for the person to feel at ease.
The patient is asked to undress. To ensure that no important sign is missed, a patient must
be examined systematically. A well tried system is to examine the patient as follows:
Start with examination of the skin, first head, then neck, shoulders, arms, trunk,
·
buttocks and legs. Look for any discouration of the skin, thickening or swelling.
Then palpation of the nerves; starting with the head and gradually going to the feet
·
Then the examination of other organs
·
Examination of the skin smear
·
Finally the examination of eyes, hands and feet for disabilities.
·
Complications due to nerve damage
Patients should be examined for the following complications which result from nerve
damage:
Injury to cornea and loss of vision due to incomplete blink and/or eye closure
·
Skin cracks and wounds on palms and sole with sensation loss
·
Clawed fingers and toes
·
Drop foot
·
Wrist drop
·
Shortening and scarring fingers and toes with sensation loss. Mark and draw also
·
wounds, clawing and absorption levels on the maps using the appropriate marks.
A dignosis of leprosy should be made if ONE of the following CARDINAL SIGNS is
presents
Skin lesion with loss of sensation
·
One or more enlarged peripheral nerves
·
A skin smear positive for leprosy baccili
·
134
12.2.4 Classification of Leprosy
The main purpose of classification is to decide on the treatment regimen to be given to the
patient. Leprosy is classified into two groups depending on the number of bacilli present
in the body. Patients considered to harbour many bacilli belong to the multibacillary (MB)
group; those with few bacilli form the paucibacillary (PB) group.
Classification is also important as it may indicate the degree of infectiousness and the
possible problems of leprosy reactions and further complications.
There are two methods of classifying leprosy, based on:
the number of leprosy skin lesions
-
the presence of bacilli in the skin smear
-
Skin smear are recommended for all new doubtful leprosy suspects and relapse or return
to control cases.
Classify patients as follows:
Multibacillary (MB) leprosy
patients with six or more leprosy skin lesions

positive skin smear

Paucibacillary (PB) leprosy
patients with one to five leprosy skin lesions

negative skin smear

If there is any doubt regarding the classification, the patient should be classified and treated
as a multibacillary case. This certainly applies to patients who have been treated in the past
and of whom insufficient information is available on the treatment previously used.
12.2.5 Treatment guidelines
Multiple drug treatment (MDT) is recommended treatment for leprosy.MDT is the
combination of a minimum of two ant-leprosy drugs..Treatment of leprosy with only one
drug (mono-therapy) will result in development of drug­resistance,therefore it should be
avoided.
Patients having multibacillary leprosy are given a combination of Rifampicin,Dapsone
and Clofezimine while those having paucibacillary leprosy are given a combination of
Rifampicin and Dapsone.Both regimens are given in the form of a blister pack on a four
weekly basis.
A patient takes a first dose under direct observation of a health worker. For the following
27 days, the patient then takes the medicine unsupervised.

Every effort should be made to enable patients to complete chemotherapy. A patient
·
whose treatment is cumulatively interrupted for more than three `months' or patient
who has missed three doses of MDT in a total and hence cannot complete the 6 doses
within 9 months, should be recommended as defaulter
If a defaulter returns later to the clinic, s/he should be given ONE- second course of
·
paucibacillary leprosy MDT.
136
Multbacillary leprosy
MB patients should receive 12 doses to be completed within a maximum period of 18
·
months.When colledting the 12th dose of MDT the patient should be released from
treatment(treatment completed)
Patient who fail to collect the 12 doses of MDT within 18 months should given ONE
·
second chance to complete a full course of Blister Pack.The procedures for asecond
course fo MB
Blister Pack as follows:-
A patient whose treatment is cumulatively interpted for more than six `months'
-
or A patient who has missed 8 doses of MDT in tatol and hence cannot
complete the 12 doses within 18 months, should be recorded as defaulter.
When a defaulter report at a clinic, asecond course of MDT should be started
-
after the importance of regular treatment has been discussed with the patient.
Patients who restart the treatment must be registerd into the unit register District
Leprosy Register again with a new number as return after default and thus should
be included in another treatment cohort for assessing completion of treatment.
Every effort should be made to ensure that patients complete the second course
-
of MDT as recommended.
After completion of the second course of MDT the patient should be recorded
-
as treatment completed.
A patient who fails to complete the second course
12.2.6 Treatment in special cases
Pregnancy: The standard MDT regimens are considered safe, both for mother
and child and should therefore be continued during pregnancy.
Tuberculosis: Patients suffering from both tuberculosis and leprosy require
appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy in addition to the MDT.
Rifampicin must be given in the dose required for the treatment
of tuberculosis. Once the intensive phase of anti TB treatment
is completed, the patient should continue with his/her monthly
rifampicin for leprosy treatment.
HIV: The management of a leprosy patient infected with HIV is the same
as that for any other patient. The response and cure rate of HIV
positive patient is the same as in other patients. The management,
including treatment reactions, does not require any modifications.
LEPROSY REACTIONS AND RELAPSE
Leprosy reaction is sudden appearance of acute inflammation in the lesions (skin
patches,nerves,other organs) of a patient with leprosy.This is due to an alteration in the
immunological status of the patient. Reactions are the major cause of nerve
damage and disability in leprosy. Therefore should be detected early and treated.
Leprosy reactions are of natural cause of the disease and can occur at any time.Reaction
commonly occurs during the early stage of disease. Sometimes patients report for first time
to a health facility because of leprosy reaction. Some reactions are seen after completion
of the treatment.
137
There are two types of reactions
Reverse Reaction(RR) or type I reaction
·
Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) or type II reaction (For detail refer
·
Manual for management of Leprosy for Health Workers)
Treatment of Reversal Reaction Or Type I Reaction
Depending on severity, treatment of RR is by giving anti- inflammatory drugs or
corticosteroids usually prednisolone for a prolonged period.
Table 26: Standard treatment of Severe RR with Prednisolone
40 mg daily ( 8 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 40mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
30 mg daily (6 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 30mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
20 mg daily (4 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 20mg Prednic pack ) 2 weeks
15 mg daily (3 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 15mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
10 mg daily (2 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 10mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
5 mg daily (1 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 5mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
Total 12 weeks
Continue MDT during treatment of reversal reaction
Table 27: Treatment of severe RR with Prednisolone at Hospital level
60 mg daily ( 12 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 1 week
50 mg daily (10 tablet of 5 mg prednisolone) 1 week

15 mg daily (3 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks
10 mg daily (2 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks
5 mg daily (1 tablet of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks
Total 22 weeks
Continue with MDT during treatment of reversal reaction
Treament for Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) or Type II reaction
Erythema Nodosum Leprosum occurs only in multibacillary leprosy patients.An estimated
5 to 10% of MB patients develop ENL reaction. It is caused by an interaction between
dead M.leprae and substances accumulating in the blood and tissues.The reacton is often
triggered by special circumstances like emotional stress, pregnancy or childbirth, infectious
diseases (malaria TB), etc
Treatment of ENL
Mild ENL: Advice the patient to rest and provide anagelsics such as aspirin (600mg
three times a day) and chloroquine if available (150 mg two times daily), for one week
138
duration .Re-examine the patient for signs of new nerve damage at weekly intervals. If
no improvement after six weeks with analgesics or signs of a more severe ENL reaction
occur, use prednisolone.
Severe ENL: Refer the patient to the nearest hospital for appropriate examinations and
treatment. Prednisolone is given for three weeks as per schedule shown below.

Recurrent ENL
A few patients get regular episodes of ENL as soon as the dose of prednisolone come
below 20 or 15 mg per day.This is called chronic or recurrent ENL. Patients with recurrent
ENL should be referred to hospital

1.1. Infections
13.1.1 Osteomyelitis
Osteomyelitis denotes infection of the bone and is most common in children under 12
years.
Clinical features: Common symptoms are fever, malaise and severe pain at the site of
bone infection. If the infection is close to a joint there may be a `sympathetic' effusion.
Staphylococci are the most frequent responsible organisms. Salmonella osteomyelitis
infection is a common complication of sickle cell anaemia.Tuberculosis osteomyelitis
occurs in association with having tuberculosis

·
For osteomyelitis, treatment may be completed orally after 4 weeks, if fever and
·
toxicity have resolved.
ESR useful as guide of efficacy of treatment
·
Alternative second line drugs for staphylococcal infection include
· Cephalosporin,
Rifampicin, Co-trimoxazole and Chloramphenicol
Treatment guidelines
(a) Acute osteomyelitis
Adults Cloxacillin give 2-3 g IV every 6 hours for 7 days and then orally for
a total of 4 weeks
Or
Clindamycin give 0.3 ­ 0.6 g I.V every 6 hours for 7 days and treat
orally for a total of 4 weeks.
Children Cloxacillin give 25 mg/kg body weight IV initially every 6 hours for
7 days and then orally for a total of 4 weeks
(b) In patients with sickle cell osteomyelitis give
Adults Ampicillin give 2 g IV every 6 hours in combination with
Flucloxacillin 2 g IV every 6 hours for 7 days then orally for a
total of 4 weeks.
Children Ampicillin50mg/kgbodyweightIVevery6hoursincombination
with
Flucloxacillin 25 mg/kg body weight IV every 6 hours for 7 days
and then orally for a total of 4 weeks.
Further treatment should be influenced by results of culture and sensitivity. In case of
salmonella being identified then give:
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg od for 21 days
In chronic osteomyelitis: surgery may be indicated. In all cases of osteomyelitis, pain
should be treated with an adequate analgesic e.g. Paracetamol 1000 mg every 6 hours or
in severe cases even Tramadol 50 ­ 100mg twice daily for 3 to 5 days
Paracetamol 10mg/kg body weight every 8 hours.

13.1.2 Tropical Pyomyositis
Clinical features: The cause of tropical pyomyositis is uncertain since abscesses
explored early are sterile but later culture of the pus usually yields Staphylococcus aureus.
The main clinical features are fever and painful indurations of one or more of the large
muscles, mostly in the lower limbs.
Treatment guidelines
Drain the pus from abscess
·
Adults Flucloxacillin (O) 500 mg every 6 hours for 14 days
Or
Erythromycin (O) 500 mg every 6 hours for 14 days
Children Flucloxacillin (O)25 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours
for 14 days
Or
Erythromycin (O)10 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours
for 14 days
13.2 Inflammatory Conditions
13.2.1 General Guidelines
The first line treatment for most of these conditions is a non-steroidal anti-
·
inflammatory drug (NSAID). This group includes Aspirin, Diclofenac and
Ibuprofen, but does NOT include Paracetamol
NSAIDs
· should be used cautiously in pregnancy, the elderly, and patients with asthma
and liver or renal impairment
NSAIDs
· should be avoided in patients with current or past peptic ulceration. Refer
patients with serious rheumatic disease and peptic ulceration for specialist help.
NSAIDs
· should be taken with food
If dyspeptic symptoms develop in a patient on
· NSAIDs, try adding magnesium
trisilicate compound tablets or mixture. If dyspepsia persists with use of NSAID
considered use of H
2
receptor antagonist (eg Cimetidine, Ranitidine)
Physiotherapy is a useful adjunct treatment in many inflammatory joint conditions
·
13.2.2 Rheumatoid Arthritis
Clinical features: RA is a chronic multisystem disease of unknown aetiology. In the
majority of patients with RA, the onset is insidious with joint pain, stiffness and symetrical
swelling of a number of peripheral joints. The clinical course is however, variable.
Treatment Guidelines
Acetylsalicylic acid give 1.2 g every 6 hours with food
Alternative medicines Ibuprofen give 400 ­ 800 mg every 8 hours. Continue for
a long as it is necessary
NOTE: Patients with intractable symptoms may require special treatment at specialists
centre
142
13.2.3 Gout
Clinical features: Gout is a recurrent acute arthritis of peripheral joints which results
from deposition, in and about the joints and tendons, of crystals of monosodium urate
from supersaturated hyperuricaemic body fluids. The arthritis may become chronic
and deforming. The main clinical features are those of an acute gouty arthritis, often
nocturnal, throbbing crushing or excruciating. The signs resemble an acute infection with
swelling, hot red and very tender joints. The first metatarsophlangeal joint of the big toe
is frequently involved.
Treatment Guidelines
General principles
Termination of acute attack
·
Prevention of recurrence
·
Prevention of further deposition of urate crystals.
·
13.2.3.1 Specific treatment for acute Attack
Give any NSAID high dose such as diclofenac orally 75 mg start then 50 mg every 8 hours
until 24 hours after relief of pain. Reduce dose to 50 mg every 8 hours for 3 doses then
25 mg every 8 hours for three doses
Alternatively, give Ibuprofen 400 ­ 800 mg every 8 hours. Continue as long as necessary.
Prevention of recurrence
Institute prophylactic diclofenac
·
In obese patient, reduce weight
·
Avoid precipitants e.g. alcohol
·
Institute anti-hyperuricaemic therapy e.g. allopurinol give 100 mg every 8 or 12 hours
·
to reduce uric acid synthesis.
Prevention or reversal of deposition of uric acid crystals by use of allopurinol and
·
dietry measures.
Aim is to maintain serum uric acid level below 8 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/1).
·
13.2.3.2 Chronic gout
Give allupurinol 100mg daily increasing weekly by 100mg to 400 mg daily, the mean dose
is 300mg.
13.2.3.3 Osteoarthritis
Clinical features: Common form of arthritis, characterized by degenerative loss
of articular cartilage, subschondral bony sclerosis, and cartilage and bone proliferation
subsequent osteophyte formation. Cause unknown, but genetic, metabolic and
biomechanical have been suggested. Gradual onset of one or a few joints involved. Pain
is the commonest symptom. Specific clinical features depend on the joint involved e.g.
enlargement of distal interphalangeal joint (Bouchard's nodes)
143
Treatment guidelines
Rest the joint Use crutches or walkers to protect weight bearing joints in severe cases.
Reduction of weight in obese patients
·
Physiotherapy ­ exercise to the affected joints
·
Medicine therapy
Acetylsalicylic acid give 900 mg orally every 6 hours with food
Or
Diclofenac give 50 mg every 8 hours
NOTE: In sever cases surgery may be indicated e.g. hip joint replacement

14. METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE DISEASE CONDITIONS
14.1 Diabetes Mellitus
Clinicalfeatures: Diabetesmellitusisaclinicalsyndromecharacterizedbyhyperglycemia,
due to deficiency or diminished effectiveness of insulin. Main clinical features of diabetes
are thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, tiredness, loss of weight, white marks on clothing, pruritus
vulvae or balanitis and paraesthesia or pain in the limbs.
Two main types have been recognized, type 1 (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, IDDM)
treated with insulin and diet and type 2 (non ­ insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
NIDDM) treated with diet and oral anti-diabetic agents.
Maintenance Therapy in Adults and children
Diet; Dietary control and maintenance of correct weight for height.
Advice on diabetic diets.
Insulin
Maintenance therapy is twice daily subcutaneous injections of a mixture of short acting
and long acting insulin in the ratio of 1:3. 2/3 of the daily dose given in the morning and
1/3 of the dose in the evening. In pregnancy an additional dose of short acting insulin
may be given with a midday meal.
NOTE:
During surgery omit the usual morning dose of insulin
·
Give small doses of short acting insulin during surgery and continue with short
·
acting insulin until the patient has resumed his usual meals
Most diabetics properly informed and managed soon become experts in their own
·
care
Be cautious about changing regimens and do not change dietary and drug regimens
·
simultaneously
Advice on diabetic diet is given later in the chapter
·
Infections may require increased dosage of insulin
·
Oral anti-diabetic agents
(a) Sulphonylureas (best taken 15 ­ 30 minutes before meals)
Chlorpropamide 125 ­ 500 mg as single dose daily
Glibenclamide 2.5 ­ 15 mg give every 24 hours before meals.
Gliclazide 40 ­ 320 mg in 2 divided doses daily
Tolbutamide 500 mg ­ 3 g give in 2 ­ 3 divided doses
Glipizide 2.5 ­ 5 mg daily shortly before breakfast or lunch, adjusted
according to response; maximum 20 mg daily; up to 15 mg
may be given as single dose
CAUTION: Chlorpropamide not to be used in elderly since it has long half life and not
to be taken with alcohol
145
(b) Biguanides
Metformin 500 - 2000 mg in 2 ­ 3 divided doses (with or after meals,
often used for obese patients)

Insulin Therapy
14.2 Hyperglycemic Pre-coma and Coma in Adults
Pass a nasogastric tube and allow free drainage in the unconscious or semiconscious patient.
Search for cause and treat infections promptly.
(a) Fluid replacement (Adults)
Normal saline is the recommended IV fluid; as much as 8 litres may be required in 24
hours:
14.1.1 PROTOCOL FOR TREATMENT WITH ORAL ANTIDIABETICS
146
Sodium chloride 0.9% (IV infusion) according to the following schedule;
First litre over 30 minutes
Second litre over 1 hour
Third litre over 2 hours
Fourth litre over 4 hours
Fifth litre over 6 hours
Give subsequent litres of normal saline every 8 hours.
The above regimen may be modified depending on the state of hydration. When blood
sugar falls to 14 mmol/l, change to dextrose 5% or dextrose-saline
NOTE: 18mg/dl equals 1 mmol/l
CAUTION: Fluid overload is dangerous in elderly patients
(b) Potassium Replacement
In conditions where blood potassium levels cannot be determined add it to IV fluid.
Potassium chloride 20 mmol with every litre of IV fluid after the first litre. Increase
to 40 mmol with each litre given over 8 hours.
Where serum potassium levels are available; start replacement of potassium at a rate of
20 mmol per litre of IV fluid as soon as insulin has been started. Assess serum potassium
regularly and adjust replacement as needed to maintain potassium at 4.0-5.0 mmol/L.
Continue with oral replacement for one week.
Potassium chloride (O) 1-2 tablets of 600 mg twice daily.
(c) Insulin Therapy (Adults)
Initially give by intramuscular injection;
Soluble insulin (IM) 10 units as a single dose, then 5 units every hour until
blood sugar is down to 16mmol/L.
When blood sugar is 14mmol/L or less ad clinical condition shows clear improvement,
change to subcutaneous administration;
Soluble insulin (SC) every four hours; dose based on a sliding scale.
Blood sugar (mmols/L) Units of Insulin
>16 12 units
>12-16 8 units
<8 0 units
147
NOTE: Use blood sugar reagent strips, "Dextrostix" or glucometer blood sugar
readings. Sliding scales using URINE glucose tests are unreliable and should be avoided
where possible.
An alternative to the sliding scale is to use an empirical dosage:
Soluble insulin (SC)
A reasonable starting dose is 10 units three times a day
Insulin doses and frequency may need to be adjusted to achieve glycaemia control. As
soon as the patient's condition is stable, start appropriate maintenance therapy.
On this regimen, most cases show definite clinical improvement within 6-10 hours. Clinical
and (if available) biochemical reassessments should be made at frequent regular intervals
during treatment. Modifications of the fluid and electrolyte therapy should be made as
necessary.
CAUTION: Sodium bicarbonate injection should be used ONLY in cases of acidosis
and if complete biochemical data are available and where blood pH determination
facility are avaiabale.
14.3 Hypoglycaemia
Hypoglycaemic symptoms include excision sweating, awareness of heartbeats impaired
mental state to frank coma.
Medicines for hypoglycaemic coma
Dextrose Infusions
·
Glucagun 1mg in stat
·
14.4 Diabetes in Children
A significant number of new cases of insulin dependent diabetes occurs in children who
usually present with classical features of diabetic ketoacidosis with polyuria, polydipsia
etc.
Hyperglycaemic Pre-coma and Coma
(a) Fluid Replacement (children)
Approximately 200 ml/kg in 24 hours is required for hydration. Start with rapid infusion
of:
Sodium chloride 0.9% at 20 ml/kg for the first hour; then for the remaining volume
give: 1/3 over next 4 hours
1/3 over next 8 hours
1/3 over next 12 hours
After the first hour, Add
Potassium chloride 20mmol/L
148
When Blood sugar is less than 14 mmol/L change to:
Dextrose 5% (IV infusion)
Or
Half strength Darrows solution
Plus
Potassium chloride 40mmol/L
(b) Insulin Therapy (Children)
Initially by intramuscular administration;
Soluble insulin (IM) 0.1 units/kg every hour; reduce to 0.05 units/kg every hour
when blood sugar fall below 15 mmols/L;
When condition stabilizes change to subcutaneous administration:
Soluble insulin (SC) 0.75-1 units/kg/day in 3 divided doses before meals.
Later, change dose to twice daily, applying the rule of thirds (see "Maintenance Therapy"
above).
Honeymoon period: In the months after initial diagnosis, insulin requirements
may decline to less than 0.5 units/kg/day as the pancreas continues to produce some
endogenous insulin. Requirements invariably revert to higher doses as endogenous insulin
levels decline.
NOTE: Diet control is important in children but a too rigid control may prove to be
counter-productive. The diabetic child should be allowed to indulge in normal activities
at school. Teachers need to be informed about the condition
(c) Diabetic Diet
Ideally a dietician should calculate dietary requirements for individual
patients.
Aim of diet control is to reduce the blood sugar to normal and to maintain a constant
blood sugar level.
45-50% of energy intake should be in the form of carbohydrates; the amount of
·
carbohydrates should be consistent from day to day
Complex carbohydrates are preferable to simple sugars.
·
Carbohydrates and calories should be evenly distributed through the day. Meals must
·
not be missed. An insulin dependent diabetic may have snack between meals
Alcohol is not allowed.
·
Sugar and sugar-containing food/drinks should be totally avoided. They only
·
exceptions are when a patient feels faint, or is ill and cannot eat normally
Exercise should be encouraged. A snack should be taken before and after playing
·
sport
149
14.5 General Advice for Diabetics
NOTE: All diabetic patients should be advised to have a "medic-alert" bracelet or
necklace and to join the Tanzania Diabetic Association
Syringes/insulin Storage
Sterile disposable syringes should be used. Insulin should be stored in a cool dry place.
Injection technique
Clean and dry skin. Inject subcutaneously NOT intradermally. The site of injection should
be varied (abdomen and thighs are the most suitable sites).
Foot Care for Diabetics
Advice about foot care is important: keep clean and dry, wear well-fitting shoes, take care
to avoid burns.
14.6 Thyroid Disease
Clinical features: Diseases of the thyroid gland are manifested by qualitative or
quantitative alterations in hormone secretion or enlargement of the thyroid gland or both.
Enlargement of the thyroid gland may result in normal, increased, or decreased hormone
secretion.
14.6.1 Hyperthyroidism
Clinical features: Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) results from an excess of circulating
thyroxine or liothyronine or both. It is usually due to diffuse hyperplasia and hypertrophy
of the thyroid gland (Graves's disease). Hyperthyroidism is characterized by an increased
metabolic rate, which causes weight loss, increased appetite, fatigue, emotional disturbances,
heat intolerance, sweating, muscle weakness and diarrhoea.
Graves' disease
Carbimazole (O) initially 40mg once daily for 3 weeks then 20 daily for 3 weeks
Toxic Nodular Goitre
Can be treated with antithyroid drugs and surgery or radioiodine
Carbimazole (O) initially 40mg once daily for 3 weeks then 20mg daily for 3 weeks.
WARNING: Carbimazole may induce bone marrow suppression. Patients should be
told to report any type of infection especially sore throat like symptoms. The drug
should be stopped immediately if neutropenic.
Check iodine function at 5 -6 weeks. Continue with 5mg Carbimazole after the situation
has normalized for up to one year
150
14.6.2 Hypothyroidism
Clinical features: Hypothyroidism is a deficiency of circulating thyroid hormones. It
may occur congenitally (cretinism) or may arise later in life. Early symptoms in neonates are
non-specific and vague but include constipation, lethargy, jaundice or respiratory distress.
Symptoms in adult cases include gradual increase in fatigue and cold intolerance, weight
gain an constipation, alopecia, angina pectoris, anaemia, depressive disorders, goiter, heart
failure and myalgia.
Treatment Guidelines
Iodised salt
· may not provide sufficient iodine and should therefore not be
prescribed alone.
Lugol's solution
· is too concentrated for daily use, and should be diluted by a factor
of 30 to give 4.2 mg/ml (Schiller's iodine).
Treatment Age under 45 years
First choice Schiller's iodine 2 drops (460 micrograms) once daily for one year.
Response may be obtained within 6 months.
Second choice: Lugol's solution 3 drops (21mg) once each month for up to one
year. Lugol's solution is stronger then schiller's iodine (see above)
Third choice Patient within this age usually responds poorly to iodine treatment
and there is a risk of iodine induced thyrotoxicosis. Iodine therapy is therefore not
recommended
14.6.3 Post thyroidectomy
Iodine should be given daily indefinitely to prevent recurrence, following dosing schedule
given above.
On Iodine use:
Physiological doses of iodine can be given even in pregnancy. It is actually necessary
·
to provide the therapy to avoid iodine deficiency to the foetus
Patients should continue taking iodized salt indefinitely (Ref. National Policy on
·
Nutrition) after the completion of treatment begin giving 1 drop (7 mg) at Lugol's
sol per month.
All salts sold for human consumption in Tanzania are required to be iodized (Govt.
·
law)
Treatment guideline
Inautoimmunethyroiditisandhypothyroidismfollowingradioiodineortotalthyroidectomy,
treat with:-
Levothyroxine (O)
Start dose 100 micrograms once daily (give half the dose to the elderly) increasing by 25-50
micrograms every four weeks as may be required.

15. NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE CONDITIONS
15.1 Infections
15.1.1 Bacterial Infections
Acute bacterial Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes of the brain or spinal
cord, i.e. of the dura matter or the pia-arachnoid matter in response to bacterial infection.
It is mainly caused by Neiseria meningitidis, Streptococcal pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.
Salmonella is less common.
Clinical Features: The disease is characterized by an intense headache, fever, intolerance
to light and sound and rigidity of muscles, especially those in the neck. Also the disease
causes acute confusional state where all mental functions are reduced especially alertness,
attentiveness and the ability to grasp the more immediate situation. Reactions are slow and
indecisive, and the patient sleeps long hours. There is a marked disturbance of perception.
As the confusion deepens, stupor and coma ensure.
In infants under 1 year diagnosis is much more difficult therefore always think of it in a
sick child if:
Refusal to eat and or suckling, drowsiness and weak cry
·
Focal or generalized convulsions
·
Fever may be absent
·
Irritability
·
Infant may be hypotonic, neck is often not stiff
·
Bulging fontanelle
·
NOTE: A lumbar puncture is essential to confirm diagnosis
Treatment guidelines
Where the organism is not known, Chloramphenicol in combination with Benzyl
penicillin are recommended.
Adults
Chloramphenicol Give 1 g every 6 hours IV initially and after a good
clinical response continue with oral treatment at the
same dose for 14 days in combination with
Benzyl penicillin 5MU IV every 6 hours initially
and after good clinical response (i.e. 48 hours after
fever settles) give same dose IM for 10 days.
Children
Chloramphenicol Give 25 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours initially I.V
and after a good clinical response give orally the same
dose for a total period of 14 days in combination
with
152
Ampicillin 50 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours initially IV and
after good clinical response give orally for a total
period of 14 days.
Where the patient has convulsions:

Chloramphenicol 6 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours, intravenously.
15.1.2 Cryptococcal Meningitis
It is chronic Meningitis caused by Cryptococcal neoformans. It develops in patients who
are immunocompromised e.g. patients with HIV having low CD count.
Clinical Features:
The disease is characterized by headache, (in 75%), fever (in 65%), intolerance to light and
sound and rigidity of muscles, especially those in the neck, vomiting, seizures, deafness
and blindness. In advanced stages in addition to exacerbation of mentioned features, the
disease causes confusional state where all mental functions are reduced especially alertness,
attentiveness and the ability to grasp the more immediate situation. Reactions are slow and
indecisive, and the patient sleeps long hours. There is a marked disturbance of perception.
As the confusion deepens, stupor and coma ensure.
153
Treatment Guidelines:
Fluconazole 400 ­ 800 mg/day (O) for 6 ­ 10 weeks, then 200 mg/day (O) indefinitely
Concurrent treatment with ARV does improve the overall prognosis of such cases

unrealistic/exaggerated anxiety often punctuated by acute attacks of anxiety or pain.
Anxiety neurosis which afflicts 5% of the population is characteristically a disorder of
young adults and affects women twice as often as men.
The illness may take many forms. Acute anxiety attacks are characterized by sudden
onset of tension, restlessness, tremor, breathlessness, tachycardia and palpitations.
Chronic anxiety state presents with persistent diffuse anxiety, motor tension, autonomic
hyperactivity, unpleasant anticipation and irritability.
Treatment guidelines

Treatment should be started with phenobarbitone alone. Full effect can be experienced
·
usually after two weeks.
Phenobarbitone can be increased to maximum if seizures persist (refer to a table
·
below)
When no improvement is obtained change to phenytoin, tapering phenobarbitone by
·
reducing the dose by 30 mg every week. If seizures persist, increase phenytoin by 50
mg increment to a maximum dose of 600 mg daily
If no appreciable improvement, change to carbamazepine, stopping phenytoin by
·
reducing dose by 50 mg per week. Increase the dose to maximum. (refer to table
below)
If possible the combination of these drugs should be avoided
·
Patients still having seizures despite having the above treatment, should be referred
·
to a higher level for treatment.

162
16. OTHER DISEASE CONDITIONS
16.1 Leishmaniasis
Clinical features: This group of diseases is caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania.
It can take two forms i.e. generalized visceral infection (kala-azar) or a purely cutaneous
infection (oriental sore). Onset of kalaazar is shown by low grade fever, splenomegaly,
enlarged liver and lymphadenopathy. In the cutaneous form, single or multiple lesions are
found on exposed parts, from where Leishman Donovan bodies can be demonstrated.
Treatment guidelines
Visceral/cutaneous leishmaniasis
Medicine of choice: Sodium stibogluconate
First choice Sodium stibogluconate 20mg (IM) per kg body weight
per day for 30 consecutive days or slow IV daily for 30 days.
Do not exceed 850 mg per day. If parasites persist, treatment
may be repeated, two to three times with a ten day interval in
between.
Second choice Pentamidine Isethionate give I.M at 2 to 4 mg/kg
body weight every 48 hours for a total of 10 injecitons.
It is less effective than sodium stibogluconate. Since an
immediate hypotensive reaction may occur, patients should
lie down during the injection and adrenaline should be at
hand. Pentamidine like Suramin, is contraindicated in renal
disease. Further, due to possible nephrotoxicity, urine must
be examined for albumin and/or casts. The presence of
either contraindicates continued use of pentamidine.
Children The same dosage as above
CAUTION: Close medical supervision is necessary during treatment
16.2 Trypanosomiasis
Clinical features: The causative organisms are the parasitic protozoa of Tryponosoma
brucei gambianse and T. brucei rhodesience. Clinical features include fever, lymphadenopathy
and CNS involvement like headache, mental confusion, tremors and pyresis. However for
relevance in treatment, two clinical divisions are noted, that is, there are patients with no
CNS involvement and those with CNS signs/symptoms.
Treatment guidelines
Medicine of choice Suramin is the medicine of choice for the early stages
of African trypanosomiasis (T.b.g.) before there is CNS
involvement. Give 20mg/Kg (to a max. of 1g in adults)
(IV) given every week for 5 ­ 6 weeks
163
Second choice Melarsoprol
Recommended dose is as follows:
Give 100mg (children 20 mg) I.V as a test dose then if there is no reaction give 20mg/kg
body weight single dose, freshly prepared (maximum 1 g) every 5 ­ 7 days.
NOTE:
Usual course is 5 doses ( don not exceed 7 doses or a total of 6 g)
·
Suramin may cause renal toxicity therefore it is contraindicated in renal diseases
·
Further, due to possible nephrotoxicity, urine must be examined for albumin and/
·
or casts the presence of either contraindicates continued use of Suramin.
Pentamidine In Trypanosomiasis due to T.b gambianse without CNS involvement the
recommended drug is freshly prepared pentamidine.
Give Pentamidine isethionate freshly prepared 4 mg/kg body weight I.M every 24
hours for 7 days ( do not exceed 300 mg/dose).
CAUTION: In patients with CNS involvement:
Start treatment with Suramin (day 1 and 2) for a total of two doses to clear blood of
trypanosomes in order to avoid a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction which will be precipitated
by destroying both CNS and peripheral trypanosomes by melarsoprol. Then give
melarsoprol 3.6 mg/kg body weight in IV infusion dissolved in 200 ml of dextrose 5%
given over a 2 hour period for 3 consecutive days. The patient should lie supine during
injection and for five hours afterwards.
The patient is then rested for 5-7 days and then the above regime of melarsoprol is
repeated. This is done once again after a further rest of 5-7 days, thus completing 3
courses of melarsoprol. Blood film and CSF are then examined for trypanosomes.
16.3 Anthrax
Clinical features: Anthrax is a disease of animals. However, man is infected directly
through contact with infected hides or inhalation of spores in the lungs or ingestion of
infected meat. Hence it can be cutaneous, pulmonary and/or intestinal. The main clinical
features are itching, a malignant pustule, pyrexia and rarely pulmonary and gastrointestinal
signs.
Treatment guidelines
Medicine of choice Benzylpenicillin
Adult 0.6 MU I.V every 6 hours until local oedema subsides then
Continue with
Phenoxymethylpenicillin 250 mg 6 hourly for 7 days.
164
Children
Premature infant and neonate 6mg/kg body weight every 6 hours until
local oedema subsides then continue with
Phenoxymethylpenicillin 62.5 mg
6 hourly for 7 days.
Infants (1-12 months) 75 mg/kg body weight daily 8 hourly until local
oedema subsides then Then continue with
Phenoxymethylpenicillin 62.5 mg 6 hourly
for 7 days
Infants (1-12 years) 100 mg/kg body weight daily 6 hourly until 1 local
oedema subsides Then give
Phenoxymethylpencillin as follows:
For child 1-5 years 125 mg 6 hourly for 7 days
For child 6-12 years 250 mg 6 hourly for 7 days
Second choice Erythromycin (O)
Adult 500 mg 8 hourly orally for 10 days
Children 10 mg/kg body weight 8 hourly for 10 days
16.4 Mastitis (Breast Abscess)
Clinical features: Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast. The common causative
organisms of the disease are either staphylococcus or streptococcal bacteria. The breast
becomes red, swollen and painful. In breast abscess, there is a collection of pus in the
breast. Clinical features of a breast abscess are tenderness, swelling, red, warm, fever and
painful lymph nodes.
General: In mastitis stage the treatment is antibiotics and antiflogistics. In abscess satge
treatment is both surgical and antibiotics.
Treatment guidelines
Flucloxacillin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days in an empty stomach.
Or
Erythromycin 500 mg orally on the first day then 100mg daily for further 6
days
and
Acetylsalicylic acid 600 mg orally, after food, every 6 hours as needed.
Instruct the patient to apply hot compresses and a constriction bandage to
relieve pain in the affected breast, and to express milk if applicable to reduce
engorgement.
165
17. VIRAL INFECTIONS
17.1 Measles
Clinical features: Measles is an acute infectious disease caused by a paramyxovirus which
is spread by droplets. It usually occurs in children under five who have not been immunized
or have been incompletely or unsuccessfully immunized. The main clinical features are
indistinguishable from an upper respiratory tract infection i.e. fever, conjunctivitis with
lacrimation, photophobia, cough and nasal discharge. Koplic spots are small red, irregular
lesions appearing in the mouth 1-2 days before rash and are diagnostic of measles. Red
maculopapular rash appearing first behind the ears and spreading to rest of body is a
feature of the disease.
Treatment guidelines
Adults Paracetamol 1 g every 8 hours for 5 days
Vitamin A 200,000 IU orally stat against vitamin A deficiency
Tetracycline eye ointment 1% apply once daily for 7 days
Children Paracetamol 10mg/kg body weight every 8 hours for 5 days.
Vitamin A if less than 1 year give 100,000 IU stat and if over 1 year
give 200,000 IU
NOTE: Give extra fluid and food
17.2 Poliomyelitis
Clinical features: Poliomyelitis is a disease caused by one of the three related polio
viruses, types 1, 2 and 3 which comprise a subdivision of the groups of enteroviruses.
Clinical features of the disease can be divided into three groups:
Non-specific febrile illness of 2-3 days duration without CNS involvement
·
Aseptic meningitis include features mentioned above
·
Paralytic poliomyelitis ­ which is the major possible outcome of the infection but
·
occurs in less than 10% of those infected.
Treatment guidelines
Give supportive therapy
Prevention
This disease is preventable by immunization with polio vaccine starting at birth. Give
·
4 doses at intervals of 4 weeks.
Parents should be told about the World program to eliminate Polio and the importance
·
of actively participating.
17.3 Viral Hepatitis
Clinical features: Viral hepatitis is a systemic infection predominantly affecting the liver.
It is caused by the hepatitis viruses A, B, non-A, non-B and delta viruses (E). The clinical
spectrum of the disease due to viral hepatitis is variable. It ranges from asymptomatic and
166
inapparent to fulminates and fatally acute infections. Subclinical persistent infections with
hepatitis virus B, non-A, and non-B, may progress to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and
possible hepatocellular carcinoma.
Treatment guidelines
Mainly supportive Therapy
Prevention:
Hepatitis types A and B are preventable by immunization. Vaccines for other types should
be made available.
17.4 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
Clinical features: The spectrum of disease due to HIV infection ranges from mild,
non-specific conditions (e.g. persistent generalized lymphadenopathy - PGL, herpes
zoster, seborrheic aczema) to its sever form i.e. Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS). Infection by the human immunodeficiency virus lead to gradual and progressive
destruction of the cell mediated immune system.
The clinical features may be due to HIV per se or as a result of immune system destruction.
Prolonged fever, diarrhoea, weight loss, skin rashes, sores, generalized pruritis, altered
mental status, persistent severe headache, oral thrush or Kaposi's sarcoma may be found
in patients with advanced disease. Most patients, however, present with symptoms due
to opportunistic infections (which are usually curable) e.g. tuberculosis, candidiasis or
pyogenic infections.
Treatment in Adults and Adolescents using Antiretroviral Medicines
(ARV)
HIV positive patients should be referred to Care and Treatment Clinics. The initial
management requires a complete work up of the patient. A complete blood count, renal
and hepatic chemical function tests, urine pregnancy test and viral load where applicable
should be done at baseline.
Initiation of treatment should be based on the extent of clinical disease progression.
CD4+ T lymphocytes counts remain the standard for evaluating immune function.
Criteria for initiation for Antiretroviral Therapy
There are three classes of individual who are clinically eligible to begin treatment
All who are in WHO stage 4 clinical criteria regardless of CD4+ cell count
·
Those in WHO stage 3 and CD4+ cells less or equal to 350/mm cubed as an indicator
·
of their progression to AIDS
All who have a CD4+ count less or equal to 200 cell/mm cubed regardless of
·
symptoms
167
17.4.1 Clinical Criteria for ART in Adults and Adolescents
Before initiating therapy in any patient, apart from clinical eligibility, it is important to
assess the patient's willingness, readness and ability to be on ART adherently. In this regard,
the following evaluation should be done:
Laboratory tests which include complete blood count, chemistry profile (serum
·
transaminases, creatinine and lipid profile) CD+T ­lymphocyte count
Chest X-ray
·
Hepatitis C serology
·
Ophthalmology examination
·
Educate patient and family members on HIV and AIDS
·
Measure viral load (where possible)
·
168
Treatment guidelines
Antiretroviral therapy both in naïve patients and those who had received treatment before,
involves the use of combination of drugs. The use of single drugs (monotherapy) in the
treatment of HIV/AIDS is not recommended. It is recommended to use the following
triple therapy consisting:
2 Nucleosides Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI) + 1 Non Nucleoside Reverse
·
Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI)
Or
2 Nucleosides Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTI) + 1 Protease Inhibitors (PI)
·
It should be noted that there is no single combination that is best for every patient and that
can be tolerated by all. Therefore, treatment regiments should be based on patient's clinical
condition, lifestyle, and ability to tolerate the regimen.
Treatment Regimen
First Line ARV Combination Regimen for Adults and Adolescents
The combinations should be used according to indications and contraindications that
govern the use of ARVs to minimize side effects and drug-drug interactions as follows:
Stavudine (d4T) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)
1.
For the first two weeks, the daily dose for Nevirapine should be 200mg. Therefore one
fixed dose combination (d4T+3TC+NVP) in the morning, and then only d4T and 3TC
tablets be taken in the evening. If well tolerated, continue at full dose of d4T+3TC+NVP
every 12 hours
Below 60kg - Use Stavudine (d4T) 30mg + Lamivudine (3TC) 150mg + Nevirapine
·
(NVP) 200mg irrespective of body weight.
Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)
2.
For the first two weeks, the daily dose for Nevirapine should be 200mg. Therefore one
fixed dose combination (AZT+3TC+NVP) should be taken in the morning, and then
only AZT and 3TC tablets in the evening. If well tolerated, continue at full dose of
AZT+3TC+NVP every 12 hours. However, it is advisable to check liver function test
Stavudine (d4T) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV)
3.
Use Stavudine (d4T) 30mg Lamivudine (3TC) 150mg every 12 hours and efavirenz
·
600mg at night.
Note: The dose for efavirenz should be less than 600 for body weight less than 40
·
kg.
169
Zidovudine (AZT) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV)
4.
Zidovudine 300mg (AZT)/Lamivudine 150mg (3TC) every 12 hours and efavirenz
·
600mg at night. Note
NOTE: The dose for adolescents of body weight 20 ­ 40kg for AZT should be 200mg
every 12 hours and that of efavirenz should be less than 600mg for patients with body
weight less than 40 kg.
First Line Regimen of ARV is summarised as follows:
d4T+3TC+NVP
·
AZT+3TC+NVP if there is peripheral neuropathy
·
d4T+3TC+EFV if the patient is on Rifampicin containing antiTb regimen or has
·
Nevirapine intolerance/hepatotoxicity and anaemia less than 7.5g/decilitre
AZT+3TC+EFV if there is Tb and no anaemia
·

Changing of Antiretroviral Therapy
There are multiple reasons that may lead to changing of ART which include:
Intolerable side effects
·
Medicine interactions
·
First Trimester of pregnancy when the patient so elects
·
ART should be stopped and or changed when there is evidence of the following:
Toxicity or intolerance to one or all medicines
·
Failure as evidence by the patient becoming symptomatic and progressive decline of
·
CD4+ count and/or rise of viral load despite the good adherence to ARVs
170
Changing of Antiretroviral Therapy because of Toxicity
The general clinical recommendation is that when changing patient's regimen due to
toxicity, only the toxic medicine(s) should be replaced, if possible as indicated in table 16
Table 33:

* only if patient is older than 3 years of age and a woman with no risk of pregnancy
** Follow up liver function tests (LFTs) closely.
Changing of Antiretroviral Therapy because of Treatment Failure
Treatment failure results from failure to suppress viral replication with the development
of viral resistance. Clinical failure is progression of disease with the development of
opportunistic infections or malignancy occurring three months or more after initiation
of ART.
Second Line Antiretroviral Therapy Regimen for Adults and Adolescents
Before treatment failure is presumed and a particular regimen discarded, every effort
should be made to rule out causes other than medicine resistance. Patients should be
evaluated for correctable factors such as:
Inappropriate dosing schedule
·
Medicine interaction that may reduce the efficacy of some of the ARV medicines
·
Non adherence due to side effects
·
Evidence of malabsorption
·
Before changing to second line medicine regimen, the patient should go through the
treatment readness and education process again. This would need to be carefully monitored
as some patients might hide their non adherence.
171
The second line regimen for adults and adolescents include the following
medicine combinations:
Abacavir 300mg every 12 hours, Lopinavir/ritonavir 133.3/33.3mg (Kaletra®) three
·
tablets every 12 hours and didanosine 200mg two tablets once per day on empty
stomach
NOTE: Didanosine (ddl) dosage is 250-300mg once daily for patients with weight less
that 60kg and 400mg once daily for patients with body weight more than 60kg.
Alternatively the following regimen can also be used:
Abacavir (ABC) 300mg every 12 hours/saquinavir/ritonavir (SQV 5x200mg or
·
100mg every 12 hours plus ritonavir 100mg capsules every 12 hours) and Didanosine
200mg, 2 tablets once per day.
Women of Childbearing and Pregnant Women
The first line treatment of women of childbearing and pregnant women should be based
sorely on their need and eligibility for Antiretroviral Therapy.
The first line regimen for this patient subgroup is AZT+3TC+NVP.
·
The second line regimen is ABC+ddl+SQV/r or NFV
·
Pregnant women who are not eligible for Antiretroviral Therapy should receive
·
prophylasix according to PMTCT guidelines
Treatment in Infants and Children using Antiretroviral Medicines
Determination of HIV infection in infants/children under 18 months possesses special
diagnostic challenges. The pathogenisis of HIV infection and the general virological and
immunological principles underlying the use of ART are similar for all HIV infected
persons. However, when prescribing ARVs in children, the following consideration should
be made namely:
Possible in utero exposure to ARV medicines
·
Difference in immunological markers among children of different age groups
·
Changeinpharmacokineticparameterswithagecausedbythecontinuingdevelopment
·
and maturation of organ systems involved in drug metabolism and clearance
Differences in the clinical virological and immunological parameters between children
·
and adults and among children of different age group
Adherence to treatment for children is influenced by parents/guardians
·
Criteria for initiation for Antiretroviral Therapy in Children
There are difficulties in making laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection in infants aged less
than 18 months due to persistent of maternal antibody, thus requiring virological testing
172
to make definitive diagnosis of HIV infection in this age group. The recommendations for
initiation of Antiretroviral therapy in children is divided into categories related to:
Age
·
Availability of virological diagnostic tests
·
When CD4+ cells assay are available, use of CD4+ cell percentage is recommended for
decision making on ART.
The availability of virologic testing is desirable, but not absolutely necessary to the
development of recommendation for the initiation of therapy in infants
Initiation of Treatment for Infants under 18 months
Initiation of Antiretroviral therapy in infants under 18 months is recommended in:
Infants with WHO stage 3 or 4 disease, initiate ART regardless of neither CD4
·
percentage nor virological confirmation/availability but confirm HIV antibody
diagnosis at 15-18 months
Infants with virological proven infection and have WHO paediatric stage 3
·
Infants are in WHO paediatric stage 1 or 2 disease with CD4 less than 20% and
·
virological confirmation
Infants less than 18 months with neither virological confirmation nor CD4 percentage
·
available, with WHO paediatric stage 3 or 4.
In these cases, HIV antibody testing must be repeated at age 18 months to definitively
confirm that the child is HIV infected. Only infants/children with confirmed infection
should have ART continued.
173
Initiation of Treatment for Infants above 18 months
Clinical features
For children above 18 months of age, a positive antibody test is an indication of HIV
infection since any acquired antibodies from mother would have degenerated, and breast
feeding has typically stopped. Initiation of ART is therefore recommended if:
WHO paediatric stage 3 or 4 HIV disease irrespective of CD4 percentage
·
WHO paediatric stage 1 or 2 HIV disease and CD4 less than 15%
·
17.4.3 CLINICAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ART IN CHILDREN UNDER 18
MONTHS
174
All children in stage 3 could be started on ART even if a CD4 percent is not available, but
attempt should be made to do a CD4 percent as soon as possible for monitoring.
Treatment Regime for Infants and Children
First line ARV Regimen
·
For children under 3 years of age: AZT+3TC+NVP
For children 3 years or more: AZT+3TC+EFV or NVP
NOTE: d4T is an alternative for AZT in case of anaemia (Hb less than 7.5g per
decilitre. The product in liquid formulation requires refrigeration
17.4.4 CLINICAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR ART IN CHILDREN ABOVE 18
MONTHS
175
Second line ARV Regimen
·
The recommended second line regimen for infants and children who have failed first line
is as follows:
Didanosine (ddl) +Abacavir (ABC)+ Lopinavir /Ritonavir (LPV/r)
NOTE: Given the bitter taste of LPV/r, children sometimes refuse it because of the
taste. Nelfinavir (NFV) may be used as a substitute for LPV/r
USE OF ARV IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Treatment of People with Tuberculosis and HIV Co-infection
The recommended first line regimen is (AZT or d4T) +3TC+EFV in which the dose of
EFV is 800mg.
Patients who develop Tb while on ART, treatment should be continued through Tb
treatment with changes as follows:
First line medicines: Substitute EFV with NVP. If this is not possible, substitute NVP
·
with ABC or SQV/r
Second line medicine: Subsitute Lopinavir/ritonavir with Saquinavir/ritonavir (dose
·
400/400mg every 12 hours- 3 extra capsules of ritonavir). This should be continued
until two weeks after completion of Tb treatment, when the extra ritonavir can be
stopped.
Treatment of People with Tuberculosis before commencing ART
If the patient has CD4+ count of more than 350 cells/mm cubed, ART is not yet
·
needed. The need for ART should be reassessed on completion of TB treatment.
If the patient has a history of WHO stage 4 illness and/or a CD4+ count of 200 -350
·
cells/mm cubed, complete 2 months of Tb therapy before commencing ART
If the patient has a CD4+ count of less than 200 cells/mm cubed or other serious HIV
·
related illness, make sure that the patient is tolerating Tb treatment before initiating
ART. Patients in this group should be started on the first line therapy consisting of
d4T/3TC/EFV
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS OF ART IN TB AND HIV CO-INFECTED PATIENTS
CD4>200 or CD4>15% Treat TB firs
CD4 50 ­ 200 or CD4 5% - 15% Treat TB first at least for 2 months before
ART (but evaluate case-by-case)
CD4<50 OR CD4<5% Can begin ART as early as 2 weeks after
TB treatment initiation

POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PEP)
The most common mode of exposure to HIV is in hospital setting where hospital workers
are at increased risk of HIV infection through exposure to body fluids through accidents
or when safety precautions are not followed. However, the other most common cause of
exposure is through sexual assault
Treatment guidelines:
The recommended treatment regimen is:
AZT 300 mg every 12 hours + 3TC 150mg every 12 hours for 4 weeks
·
A third medicine, EFV or NVP (proposed Indinavir) should be added if there have
·
been multiple perpetrators, anal penetration occurred, trauma to the genital areas, if
one of the perpetrators is known to be HIV positive
Patient allegedly sexually assaulted

18. ALLERGIC REACTIONS
18.1 Anaphylaxis (Acute Hypersensitivity)
Anaphylaxis is a life threatening clinical response that appears within minutes after
administration of substance(s) to which the subject has been sensitized. Common
offenders are drugs (e.g. penicillin), vaccines, insect stings, blood products and food like
seafood, nuts, etc.
Clinical features: These include respiratory distress due to oedema of the hypopharynx
and larynx or bronchospasm and vascular collapse (shock with hypotension). Others
include pruritus and urticaria.
Treatment Guidelines:
Any delay in recognition/diagnosis and prompt treatment may lead to death. Immediately
do the following
Adrenaline 0.5-1 mg I.M. repeated every 15 minutes until improvement occurs
·
Laying of patient flat and elevating feet
·
Restoration of blood pressure ­ with I.V fluids (sodium chloride 0.9%)
·
Chlorpheniramine 10-20 mg I.V stat or Promethazine 25mg I.M. every 8-12 hours
·
Oxygen may be required in severe respiratory embarrassment (4-6 1/min)
·
Hydrocortisone 200 mg I.V every 6 hours for 24 hours would prevent further
·
deterioration
If asthma develops, give Aminophylline I.V or nebulised Salbutamol
·
Prevention can be achieved by taking relevant history before administering materials
·
known to produce a high rate of anaphylaxis. Skin test should be done when in
doubt
Write the name of the drug or substance that caused the reaction and educate the
·
patient and relatives on future avoidance. Patients should be asked to always mention
allergies for drugs when visiting a clinic/prescriber.
178
19. HAEMATOLOGICAL DISEASE CONDITIONS
19.1 Anaemia
Clinical features: Anaemia is a state in which the level of haemoglobin in the blood is
below the expected value for age and sex. Anaemia may be due to blood loss, haemolysisi
or decreased production of red blood cells.
The clinical presentation of anaemia depends on the underlying disease, severity and
abnormality of the anaemia. These may include, fatigue, palpitation, headache, pallor and
features of heart failure may occur in sever cases.
Treatment guidelines
(a) General
Treat the cause, for example in iron deficiency anaemia due to hookworm, deworm
·
the patient.
Blood transfusion is only indicated where it is life saving.
·
(b) Iron deficiency anaemia
Adult Ferrous sulphate (O) 200 mg every 8 hours
Children Ferrous sulphate (O) 5 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours.
Continue for 3 months after the normal haemoglobin level has been achieved.
(c) Folic Acid deficiency
Folic acid (O) 2.5 ­ 5 mg- once daily for at least 2 months
(d) Vitamin B 12 deficiency anaemia
Hydroxocobalamin 1 mg daily parenterally for one week and 1 mg every 2-3 months
thereafter for life.
19.2 Sickle Cell Anaemia
Clinical features: Sickle cell anaemia is a hereditary disease resulting form inherited
haemoglobin S. In the homozygous state there may be sickle cell anaemia. Onset of
symptoms is usually after 6 months of life. Symptoms may include anaemia, dactylitis,
recurrent infections, impaired growth and development.
Sickle cell disease may present with crises. Crises may be in the form of thrombotic crises
precipitated by cold, infection, physical exertion etc which cause pain often in the bones.
Other types of crises may also occur. These include haemolytic, aplastic and sequestration
crises. In aplastic crises there is anaemia with a low reticulocyte count. In sequestration
crises, the spleen and liver enlarge rapidly due to trapping of red blood cells. Anaemia is
very severe in this case.
179
Treatment Guidelines
Treat symptomatically. Therapeutic objective is to prevent the development of crises and
to treat crises and complications. Give
Folic acid
· give 5 mg daily
Chloroquine
· give as required
Acetylsalicylic acid
· give as required
In crisis
Prompt determination and treatment of precipitating cause eg Malaria infection
·
Give intravenous fluid and electrolyte therapy
·
Adults 5%Glucose in 0.9% Sodium Chloride
Children 4.3% Glucose in 0.18% Sodium Chloride
Give pain relievers eg Paracetamol. In severe pain (with no difficulty in breathing)
·
give Pethidine IM
Adults 25-100 mg repeated every 4 hours as required
Children 0.5-2 mg/kgbody weight repeated every 4 hours as required
19.3 G6PD deficiency
Clinical features: G6PD is an inherited X-linked recessive genetic disorder. Usually
asymptomatic but liable to haemolysis if causative drugs or foods are taken (e.g.
sulphonamides or proguanil).
Treatment Guidelines
Avoid causative agents/foods or drugs
·
Transfusion of packed cells volumes in severe anaemia. Give 2-3 ml/kg body weight
·
over a period of 8 hours once every 24 hours for 3 days.
19.3.1 Bleeding Disorders
Hereditary bleeding disorders
Precaution and Management
Avoid I.M injections
·
Avoid use of aspirin, instead use paracetamol
·
Inform the patient thoroughly on the problem, and provide means of alerting other
·
medical/pharmaceutical personnel
Once you know make early referral of such patients for specialist management.
·
For haemarthrosis ­
· AVOID to incise joint. Treat by replacement of specific factor,
joint support and I.V or oral morphine.
19.3.2 Haemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency)
Amount of factor VIII given depends on assessment of severity of bleeding. Use table to
determine dosage, for both children and adults according to body weight.

adult
1 bag/kg
NOTE:
For 1, 2, 3 above repeat dose 12 hourly if bleeding persists or swelling is increasing.
·
With more severe bleeds it is usually necessary to continue treatment with half of
total daily dose 12 hourly for 2-3 days, occasionally longer.
For 4, start therapy 8 hours before surgery, continue 12 hourly therapies for 48
·
hours post-operatively and if NO bleeding occurs, scale down gradually over next
3-5 days.
As adjunct to factor replacement in mucosal or gastro-intestinal bleeding and
·
surgery give fibrinolytic inhibitor:
Tranexamic acid (O) 500 - 1000 mg three times a day. DO NOT use for
·
haematuria
In an emergency, fresh frozen plasma can be used to treat bleeding in
·
haemophiliacs
19.3.3 Haemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency)
(a) Mild bleed
Factor IX concentrate 2 bottles (500 IU/bottle) in adults
Or
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 1 bag/15 kg body weight (4-5 bags for average adult)
(b) Major bleeding
Factor IX concentrate 3-6 bottles (500IU/bottle) in adults
Or
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 1 bag/7.5 kg body weight (8-10 bags in adults).
Repeat in 24 hours if bleeding continues.
181
(c) As adjunct to replacement therapy
Tranexamic acid (O) 500 ­ 1000 mg three times a day as for Haemophilia A
For children use appropriate proportions.
·
Factor VIII concentrate and cryoprecipitate are not useful for Haemophilia B,
·
so accurate diagnosis is essential.
Some Haemophlia A and B patients are on recommended dosage but may
·
require assistance form health personnel
19.4 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD)
Treat as for mild or moderate bleeding of Haemophilia A except that the haemostatic dose
may be repeated not 12 hourly but after 24 ­ 48 hours since therapeutic response is more
sustained in VWD.
19.5 Acquired Bleeding Disorders/Platelet Disorders
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
Monitor prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated
·
partial thromboplastin (APTT), platelet count and fibrogen.
Identify if possible and treat/remove cause of DIC
·
If PT/APTT prolonged and patient is bleeding give, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 1
·
bag/15 kg body weight (4-5 bags in adults). Repeat FFP after 24 hours if indicated
If platelet count < 50000 and patient is bleeding give: platelet concentrate 4-6 bags
·
(adults)
If fibrogen is low and/or APTT prolonged give (to supply fibrogen and FVIII):
·
cryoprecipitate 1 bag/6kg (8-10 bags in adults).
The use of heparin is NOT recommended in bleeding patients with DIC
·
19.6 Haemorrhagic Disease of the Newborn
The policy is to give vitamin K routinely to all newborns as a preventive measure. However,
if haemorrhaging occurs, give
Vitamin K (I.M) 1 mg once daily for 3 days
19.7 Idiopathic thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)
Prednisolone (O) 1 mg/kg once daily, gradually reducing the dose over subsequent
weeks. Consider splenectomy for those in whom steroids fail to achieve adequate control
or who relapse after treatment.
19.8 Anticoagulation
Duration of treatment
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): 6 ­ 8 weeks except in pregnancy, or if there is another
·
reason for prolonged treatment
Pulmonary embolism (PE): 3 months
·
Atrial fibrillation: life long treatment
·
Heart valve prostheses: life long treatment.
·
After DC cardioversion, duration 4 weeks
·
182
(a) Heparin Treatment
Prophylaxis against DVT
Following surgery and immobility e.g. cardiac failure:
Heparin (SC) 5,000 units every 8 hours until ambulant
Treatment of DVT/PE
Heparin (IV) 10,000 units every 6 hours
Monitor APTT ­ aim for 2-3 times control
Continue until warfarin is effective, usually 3-5 days.
If facilities for monitoring APTT and INR are not available, DVT, may be treated with:
Heparin (SC) 10,000 units twice daily
Or
Warfarin after first trimester (12 weeks) keeping INR in the range 2-3. At 32-34 weeks
stop Warfarin and change to Heparin as above
CAUTION Warfarin may harm the foetus and should not be used under 12 weeks.
Monitor closely whichever method is used. Specialist supervision is recommended
Heparin Over dosage
If bleeding occurs, stop heparin and give:
Protamine sulphate (slow IV) 1 mg neutralizes 100 units of Heparin.
Maximum doses 50 mg (in excess protamine is also an anticoagulant).
(b) Oral Anticoagulation
Warfarin (O) loading dose 10mg once daily for 2 days. Check INR on 3rd day and dose
accordingly. The drug should be taken at the same time each day.
Therapeutic range for Warfarin use
DVT/PE: INR 2-3, heart valve prothesis: INR 3-4.5
There is great individual variation in dose (average daily dose 3-9 mg). Monitor INR
regularly, initially daily/alternate days then increase interval gradually to a maximum of 8
weeks. Reduce loading dose in elderly and in patients with renal/hepatic impairment.
Drug Interacting with Warfarin
CAUTION Drug interactions are common and can be dangerous
Below are few examples:
183
Warfarin Inhibition Warfarin Potentiation
Barbiturates Alcohol
Oral contraceptives Chloramphenicol
Griseofulvin Cimetidine
Rifampicin Erythromycin
Carbamazepaine Co-trimoxazole
Vitamin K Acetylsalicylic acid
Warfarin Overdosage:
If INR 4.5 ­ 7 without haemorrhage ­ withhold Warfarin for 1-2 days then review
If INR > 7 without haemorrhage ­ withhold Warfarin and check INR daily.
Consider giving:
Vitamin K (slow IV) 0.5 ­ 1 mg injection (not IM)
If INR>4.5 with haemorrhage, give:
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 2-4 bags, then check INR and repeat infusion if bleeding
continues.
Plus
Vitamin K (Slow IV) 0.5 ­ 1 mg (higher doses Vitamin K will prevent adequate
anticoagulation for up to 2 weeks).
(c) Streptokinase Treatment
Life Threatening Myocardial infaction and Pulmonary Embolism/Arterial Embolism
Streptokinase (IV) loading dose of 250000 units over 30 minutes, then 100000 units every
hour for 24-72 hours
CAUTION: Allergic reactions may occur before infusion give: hydrocortisone (IV)
100 mg.
184
20. NUTRITIONAL DISEASE CONDITIONS
20.1 Avitaminosis
20.1.1 Vitamin A Deficiency
Clinical features: Vitamin A deficiency is usually associated with protein energy
malnutrition and measles infections. It most commonly affects the eyes when the condition
is called xerophthalmia. The most common clinical features of Vitamin A deficiency are:
night blindness, photopobia, conjunctival xerosis, bitot's spots, corneal xerosis, corneal
ulceration and keratomalacia.
Treatment guidelines
Adult Vitamin A 200,000 IU orally on days 1, 2, 7 and 14.
Infants Give half the adult dose for the same duration.
20.1.2 Vitamin D Deficiency
Clinical features: Rickets is a disease of bones in infants and children the development
of which requires the simultaneous lack of dietary vitamin D and sunlight.
Treatment guidelines
Prevent deficiency by exposing skin to sunlight
·
Ergocalciferol give 1000-5000 IU per day orally for 2 weeks and then follow up this
·
with 4000 IU per day for two months.
20.1.3 Nicotinic Acid Deficiency (Pellagra)
Clinical features: Pellagra is a disease characterized by the triad of dermatitis, diarrhoea
and dementia.
Treatment guidelines
Nicotinamide
Adult 100 mg every 6 hours for 7 days followed by a multivitamin preparation
containing 50 - 60 mg of nicotinamide daily for one month.
Children 10-25mg every 8 hours for 7 days followed by multivitamin preparation
as above.
20.1.4 Thiamine Deficiency (Beriberi)
Clinical features: The primary disease of thiamine deficiency is beriberi. There are
four principal types; acute and wet beriberi; infantile beriberi, chronic or dry beriberi
and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In Tanzania beriberi is commonly caused by
consumption of highly meal cereals or food containing thiaminase (anti-thiamine factors)
and in alcoholics.
185
Treatment guidelines
Thiamine 5-25 mg IM every 12 hours for three days followed by the same dose orally
for four weeks.
20.1.5 Riboflavin Deficiency
Clinical features: The deficiency syndrome is characterized by sore throat, pharyngeal
and oral mucous membrane hyperaemia, angular stomatitis, cheilosis, glossitis, and
anaemia. Riboflavin deficiency almost invariably occurs in combination with other vitamin
deficiencies.
Treatment guidelines
Vitamin B complex (O) one tablet every 8 hours for 1 month
20.1.6 Pyridoxine Deficiency
Clinical features: As in Riboflavin deficiency, specific disease or clinical features
associated with Vitamin B deficiency is rare. However it may occur during isoniazid
therapy where peripheral neuritis may develop.
Treatment Guidelines
Pyridoxine (O) 50 mg every 8 hours until recovery
For Isoniazid induced B1 deficiency replace Isoniazid with Ethambutol.
20.1.7 Ascorbic Acid Deficiency
Clinical features: Scurvy is the primary deficiency disease. Clinical features of scurvy
include follicular hyperkeratosis, swollen, purple and spongy gums which bleed easily.
Haemorrhages may occur in other sites.
Treatment guidelines
Ascorbic Acid 100 mg orally every 8 hours until a maximum of 4 g and then 100 mg
orally for one month.
A diet rich in Vitamin C eg Oranges and other citrus fruits and vegetables should be
recommended
20.1.8 Vitamin K Deficiency
Clinical features: Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis in liver for prothrombin;
factor VII, IX and X. Primary deficiency occurs only in neonates. Secondary Vitamin K
deficiency may be associated with malabsorption syndromes, liver cirrhosis and the use of
Coumarin derivatives like Dicumarol, Warfarin and other analogues.
Treatment guidelines
Phytomenadione 10mg IV stat (neonates 1 mg IM)
20.1.9 Protein energy maultrition
Clinical feature: Marasmus
186
21. MALIGNANT DISEASE CONDITIONS
21.1 Hepatoma
Clinical features: This is a malignant neoplasma of the liver which may occur either
with or without accompanying hepatic cirrhosis. There is a strong association of this
cancer and hepatitis B infection.
Clinical features of the condition include a history of right upper abdominal pain often
associated with weight loss and fever. There may be considerable abdominal swelling due
to liver enlargement with or without ascites.
Prevention
Vaccination by Hepatitis B
Treatment Guidelines
General supportive measures Paracetamol (O) 500mg every 4-6 hours for the
duration of pain
Detailed overall management guidelines will appear in the Oncology Manual prepared by
the Tanzania Tumour Centre (TATUC).
21.2 Cancer of the Cervix
Whereas the aetiology of cancer of the cervix is unknown, identified predisposing
factors include, human papilloma virus infection, there is a strong association with HIV
infection.
Prevention
Routine screening through visual inspection of cervix plus Iodine painting of cervix and
acetic acid; Pap smear and colposcopy.
Vaccination if available
Clinical features: Abnormal vagina bleeding or vaginal discharge associated with
contact e.g. sexual intercourse.
Treatment Guidelines
Stage 1a cancer of the cervix is best treated by total hysterectomy and/or
·
radiotherapy
Stage 1b and above are primarily treated with radiotherapy.
·
Early detection and referral to Tumour Centre, at Ocean Road Hospital is important
·
21.3 Cancer of the Breast
It is a malignant tumour of the glandular tissue of the breast
Clinical features: A solitary lump in the breast must be regarded as breast cancer
until proved otherwise. Hardness, attachment to skin or deeper tissues, skin ulceration,
nipple retraction or presence of axillary lymphadenopathy are features pointing towards
malignancy.
187
Treatment Guideines
Early detection and referral to a Tumor centre
·
21.4 Kaposi's Sarcoma
Kaposi's sarcoma is a malignant tumour of angio-formative cells usually starting from
the skin but occasionally involving many other organs of the body. There are three
epidemiological variants-sporadic, endemic and epidemic form which is associated with
infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Clinical features: It is present as firm-dark brown nodules or plaque in the skin
usually on the limbs. In young children and those with immunodeficiency, wide spread
lymphadenopathy with or without skin lesions.
Treatment guidelines
Early detection and referral to tertiary centre. Mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy.
Where chemotherapy is not beneficial palliative radiotherapy may be given.
21.5 Leukaemia
Theleukaemiaisaheterogenousgroupof neoplasmsarisingfrommalignanttransformation
of the haematopoietic cells.
Clinical features: The leukemias may be acute or chronic. The clinical presentation
will depend on the state and type of leukemia.
Treatment guidelines
Early detection and referral to tertiary centre
·
Treatment with chemotherapy may be useful in some types of leukemias. Large
·
spleens benefit from radiotherapy.
21.6 Burkitt's Tumour
Burkitt's tumour is an undifferentiated lymphoblastic lymphoma. It shows close association
and infection with the Epstein Barr virus.
Clinical features: The clinical picture varies with age of the patient, the typical jaw
tumour being the commonest in the younger patient.
Treatment guidelines
Early detection and referral to tertiary centres
·
Curative treatment comprises of combination chemotherapy. Paliation with
·
cyclophosphamide is of good but temporary benefit.
188
22. BITES
22.1 Animal Bites
Clinical features: Animals that bite man include both wild and domesticated ones.
Thus lion, tiger, leopard, hyena, bear, hippopotamus, wolf and wild pig are examples of the
wild animals that have bitten man but human bites also occur. Others are fish, crocodiles
and dogs. Clinical features of these bites arise from the pathology inflicted by teeth, tusks,
claws and horns. They produce lacerations, penetrating and crushing injuries. Severe
facial and eye injuries are common and pneumothorax, hemothorax, bowel perforation
and compound fractures have occurred.
Treatment Guidelines
Emergency surgery is often needed. Replacement of blood loss may be necessary..
Treatment of other of injuries may be required as necessary e.g. resultant rabies, tetanus,
pneumothorax.
Prevention and treatment of complication is also mandatory eg prevention of rabies,
tetanus and HIV (human bite)
Treat infection with relevant antibiotics.
Tetanus Toxoid 0.5ml start. Repeat after 4 weeks and then 6-12 months later
22.2 Insect Bites
Common insect bites include scorpions, bees and spiders.
Clinical features included pain, swelling, local and systemic allergic reactions.
Treatment Guidelines
Give appropriate analgesics
Where there is an anaphylactic reaction treat according to guidelines.
22.3 Snake Bites
Clinical features: Contact with snakes, scorpions and other insects result in two types
of injuries: those due to direct effect of venom on victim and those due to indirect effect
of poison e.g. hypersensitivity reaction to bee sting.
Less than 10% of 3500 snake species are poisonous and they include cobras and mambas
(Elapidac). Sea snakes (hydrophidac) and the boomslang and vine snakes (columbidac).
Clinical condition depends on the type of snake bite and amount of poison (venom)
injected. Hence envenomation (poisoning) will be neurotoxic in Cobras and Mambas and
sea snakes and haemotoxic in Vipers and Boomslang.
Treatment guidelines
Reassure the patient
·
Clean bitten site with clean water to remove any poison and remove any fangs.
·
189
Remove any tourniquets and assess degree of envenomation. By vipers rapid swelling
·
for 24 hours. In severe envenomation by vipers rapid leg swelling from hemorrhage
into anterior compartment of lower limb may contain as much as 2 units of blood
Rarely will there be need to use specific antivenom
·
When indicated (by the degree of envenomation) use
· polyvalent anti-snakes
venom (PAV)
Infuse 80-100ml of (PAV) diluted in 500ml normal saline and start drip very slowly
·
Watch for persensitivity reaction and be prepared with already drawn out 100mg
·
hydrocortisone and Adrenaline. If reaction occurs, stop drip and give
Hydrocortisone and Adrenaline and re-start drip after 1 hour and again watch
for reaction.
Debridement of necrotic tissue where necessary.
·
NOTE: Reaction is from horse serum contained in the polyvalent serum
Dose of polyvalent serum will depend on degree of envenomation. Same for both
·
adults and children. The SAMRI variety of polyvalent is best compared to others. Use
polyvalent since often the type of snake is unknown. There are specific monovalent
sera where type of snake is known.
Analgesics, antihistamines, blood letting are all absolute. With reassurance, competent
·
clinical observation, very few cases need active treatment since envenomation is
rare.
Snake venom spat into eyes must be washed thoroughly with water.
·
190
23. BURNS
Clinical features: It is thermal trauma to the skin, mucosae and deeper tissues.
Classification depends on depth and extent. If area burnt is larger than 10% of body
surface area then this is extensive because of fluid loss, catabolism, anaemia and risk of
secondary infection.
The `rule of 9' to calculate % of body surface burned, can be used.

Treatment Guidelines
Ensure that there is an adequate airway, adequate breathing and adequate circulation
Immerse burnt area in cold water for 10 minutes
·
Clean with
· Normal saline or Chlorhexidine ­ cetrimide solution
Apply oxytetracycline + hydrocortisone spray
·
Calculate fluid requirement per 24 hours
· weight x% of surface burnt x 2 =
quantity of fluid
Give 75% of fluid requirement as
· sodium lactate compound solution and
25% as 6% Dextran 70 as blood/plasma expanders. Give first half in 8 hours
and the rest within 24 hours.
Give appropriate analsegic and sedation
·
Give tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml. stat
·
Immobilize in position of function and change dressing whenever necessary
·
Debridement where indicated
·
Give
· Procaine Penicillin 1.2 MU IM every 24 hours or Erythromycin or
Flucloxacillin where indicated but not antibiotic ointment
In full thickness burns, skin grafting may be indicated to speed wound healing. In
·
such cases refer to secondary or tertiary level health care centre
Children Paracetamol 10 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours
Procaine Penicillin 0.4 ­ 1.2 MU IM once daily
191
24. FOREIGN BODIES
Foreign bodies may be introduced into any of the body orifices nose, ears, vagina and
urethra. Foreign bodies introduced through the mouth (or nose) may be arrested in the
larynx, bronchial tree, oesophagus or stomach.
Clinical features: Depends on the affected site. The symptoms may be due to
obstruction or inflammation around the foreign body.
Treatment Guidelines
Foreign bodies into the ears, nose, urethra, vagina, larynx and bronchial tree should be
removed at adequately equipped facility.
Foreign bodies in the stomach rarely produce symptoms and active treatment is usually
not required.
192
25. PAIN
Clinical features: Pain is the most common symptom of disease. For most patients,
correct treatment of self-evident, limited disease process (e.g. broken bone) alleviates
the pain. In some disease conditions, for examples cancer, pain is the most important
symptom particularly if it is irrationally treated. 60 ­ 100% of patients with advanced or
terminal cancer experience severe pain.
Treatment Guidelines
General
Treat the cause of pain
·
Specific guidelines
For Acute somatic pain give
·
Adults Acetylsalicylic acid 600 mg every 4 hours util pain subsides
Or
Paracetamol 500 ­ 1000 mg every 6 ­ 8 hours
Children Paracetamol 250 ­ 500 mg every 6-8 hours.
For severe pain
·
Tramadol give 50 ­ 100 mg every 4 - 6 hours until pain is controlled. In the event
of failure of this dose give:
Morphine
Adult 10 mg IV every 6 hours on a "when necessary" basis
Children 0.2 mg/kg body weight IV every 4-6 hours
For surgery and obstetric conditions give pethidine 100 mg IM or IV every 6 hours on a
"when necessary" basis.
Cancer pain
·
Give narcotic analgesics e.g. morphine 10mg every 4 hours on a "when
necessary"basis. Because the patients suffer from continuous or recurrent acute
pain, tolerance to narcotics is common therefore doses must be increased. In cases
of intractable pain, give morphine through spinal epidural or through an intrathecal
catheter. Adequate cancer pain relief requires careful titration of morphine with
slowly increasing doses. Also remember to use laxatives concurrently.
193
26. POISONING
Poisoning can be accidental or intentional and may be due to various substances.
Clinical Features: For the majority of poisons, the clinical features are non specific
and may include: coma, convulsions, acute confusion, hepatic and/or renal failure, skin
eruption, psychiatric or neurologic disturbance of acute onset. Relevant history should be
elicited from patient, relatives or friends.
Treatment Guidelines
Optimal management of a poisoned patient required correct diagnosis (and identification
of the poison).
Maintain adequate respiration (clear airway) and circulation
·
Gastric wash out with 0.9 Sodium Chloride if poison ingested within 3-4 hours
·
Inactivate poison where specific antidote exist.
·
Activated charcoal (up to 50 gm suspended in clean water) for adults.
·
For children 6-12 years 25gm activated charcoal suspended in clean water
For children 0-6 years 12.5 gm activated charcoal suspended in clean water
If necessary give via G.I tube.
Induce emesis with Syrup Ipecacuanha.
