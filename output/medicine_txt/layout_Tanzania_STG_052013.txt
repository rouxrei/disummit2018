   STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES
       AND ESSENTIAL MEDICINES LIST

FOREWORD

The Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG) and the National Essential Medicine List for Tanzania
(NEMLIT) was first published in 1991. The fourth edition includes new sections on symptoms
and syndrome. The STGs have been updated and are consistent with current national guidelines
for diagnosis and management of common diseases. The guidelines also reflect changes in the
management of various diseases including asthma and hypertension following
recommendations from WHO and experts from international medical associations and agencies.
There have been improvements in the format of treatment regimens, showing more clearly the
classification of medicines by level of health care within the treatment guidelines, and not just
in the NEMLIT.

The STG and NEMLIT aims at providing health practitioners with standardized guidance in
making decisions about appropriate health care for specific conditions found in Tanzania. By
using STGs, prescribing practices can be rationalized and patient outcomes can be improved
while making optimum use of the limited resources for medicines. The NEMLIT attached to the
STG retains its purpose of identifying medicines that are considered essential for the treatment
of common disease conditions in Tanzania. The medicine list is in line with the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommendations under Tanzania conditions. It follows the principles and
concepts of essential medicines so as to simplify the management of medicines supply and
support a streamlined logistics system.

This set of tools is meant to be a guide for quick reference and its recommendations are valid
for most presentations of the conditions covered. Nevertheless, clinical judgment and
experience will always prevail for adjustment of treatment in individual cases when necessary.

This new edition of STGs provides Medicines and Therapeutics Committees (MTCs) at our health
institutions an opportunity to strengthen their role in improving therapeutics and management
of medicines in practice. MTCs are requested to promote the concepts of evidence based
selection of medicines and cost-effective treatment protocols and facilitate STGs to be applied in
their specific practice settings, translating and incorporating into local guidelines, formularies
and in-service training programmes.

The Ministry's policy is that all public and private health workers in Tanzania will promote and
adhere to these Standard Treatment Guidelines, and that prescribing, purchasing, labeling and
dispensing of medicines should be by generic names as much as possible, and consistent with
the level classification in the STGs and NEMLIT.

It is my hope that all health workers in Tanzania will find this document a useful tool in
management of patients' illinesses.

                       Hon. Dr. Hussein Mwinyi (MP)
        MINISTER FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE

                       HOW TO USE THE DOCUMENT

The guideline covers chapters of common diseases in Tanzania. Most chapters start with a title,
a brief description of the topic, common clinical signs and symptoms of each disease, the
diagnosis and differentials, investigations, treatments and supportive care. The document
comprises the national Essential Medicines List (NEMLIT) which will be used in the public health
facilities. The medicines will be used to treat the majority of public health problems and they
should be available to health facilities at all time. The guideline also makes provision for referral
of patients to higher health facilities.
The indices for all medicines used are found at the back of the guide book, together with the
information on how to report the adverse drug reactions. All health care workers are
encouraged to report suspected adverse drugs reactions (ADR) when the reaction is potentially
serious or clinically significant. The guideline also, makes provision for referral of patients to
higher health facilities see the referral form. The last pages of the guideline contain annexes,
references as well as the Essential Medicines List.
It is important to remember that the recommended treatments provided in this document are
evidence, clinically approved and are in consistent with the already existing WHO guidelines.
Comments that aim to improve these treatment guidelines will be appreciated all the time and
the form for that purpose is appended.

           CHAPTER ONE

           SYNDROMIC APPROACH

1.0 PAIN

Pain is the most common symptom of disease. It is an unpleasant sensation localized to a part
of the body. It is often described in terms of a penetrating or tissue-destructive process (e.g.,
stabbing, burning, twisting, tearing, squeezing) and/or of a bodily or emotional reaction (e.g.,
terrifying, nauseating, sickening). Any pain of moderate or higher intensity is accompanied by
anxiety and the urge to escape or terminate the feeling.

Diagnosis
Self-report is the key to pain assessment. In non- or pre verbal children, facial expression is the
most valid indicator of pain; therefore use faces pain scale to assess severity. Pain should be
assessed by:

      Duration
      Severity, e.g. does the patient wake up because of the pain
      Site
      Character, e.g. stabbing, throbbing, crushing, cramp like
      Persistent or intermittent
      Relieving or aggravating factors
      Accompanying symptoms
      Distribution of pain
      In children pain can be assessed by childs' crying voice, posture, movement and colour.

1.1 Treatment for Acute and Mild pain

Aspirin, Paracetamol, and Non -steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (NSAIDs); these drugs are
considered together because they are used for similar problems and may have a similar
mechanism of action.

Adult

           A: Acetylsalicylic acid 600mg every 4 hours until pain subsides
                                        OR

           A: Paracetamol 500- 100mg every 6-8 hours until pain subsides.

Children

           A: Paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose 4­6 hourly when required to a maximum
           of 4 doses per 24 hours;

1|P a g e

1.2 Treatment for Severe Pain

Opioids are the most potent pain-relieving drugs currently available.They have the broadest
range of efficacy, providing the most reliable and effective method for rapid pain relief.

Adults : C: Tramadol tablets or injection 50-100mg every 6 hours or until pain is controlled.
                                       OR

            C: Morphine 10mg IV every 6 hours on a "when necessary" basis;
Children: 0.2mg/kg body weight IV every 6 hours.

For sugery and obstetric conditions
            C: Pethidine 100mg IM/ IV every 6 hours when necessary.

CAUTION Opioids may cause respiratory depression; therefore use opioids carefully. In case
of toxicity, reverse with the narcotic antagonist naloxone.

                   C: Naloxone 0.1-0.2mg IV intermittently. Max. dose 10mg

Do not administer morphine in:
     advanced liver disease
     severe head injury
     acute asthma
     advanced chronic obstructive bronchitis, emphysema or other
     respiratory disease with imminent respiratory failure
     untreated hypothyroidism

Use morphine with extreme care if there is:
     Recent or concurrent alcohol intake or other CNS depressants
     Hypovolaemia or shock
     In the elderly

Referral
Refer to Regional and Tertiary care for:

     All children with moderate and acute severe pain
     No response to oral pain control and unable to initiate opioids therapy
     Uncertain diagnosis
     Management of serious underlying conditions

Pain Associated with Trauma or Inflammation
See under Trauma and Injuries section

1.3 Treatment for Chronic Non Cancer Pain

Chronic pain is a pain that persist for more than 4 weeks chronic pain can arise from:
     Tissue damage (nociceptive pain), e.g. arthritis, fibromyalgia's, lower back pain,
         pleurisy, cancer pain etc

2|Page
     Injury to nerves (neuropathic pain) e.g. post herpetic neuralgia (pain following
         shingles), trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, HIV related peripheral neuropathy,
         drug induced peripheral neuropathy or phantom limb

     Abnormal nerve activity following disease
Psychological evaluation and behaviorally based treatment paradigms are frequently helpful,
particularly in the setting of a multidisciplinary pain-management center.

Drug Treatment
Mild Pain

    Adult: A: Paracetamol 1000 mg (O) 6 hourly until pain subsides

Pain Associated with Trauma or Inflammation
See under Trauma and Injuries section

Moderate pain (Including neuropathy)
Adults: If still no relief to simple analgesics as above, add

                   C: Tramadol 50 mg (O) 4­6 hourly as a starting dose
                   May be increased to a maximum of 400 mg daily

Adjuvant therapy
Adults: In addition to analgesia as above add antidepressants;

                   C: Amitriptyline 25 mg (O) at night; Maximum dose: 75mg.
Anticonvulsants and Antiarrhythmics may also be helpful in neuropathic pain. Give
Phenytoin or carbamazepine.

Referral
     Pain requiring strong opioids
     Pain requiring definitive treatment for the underlying disease
     All children

1.4 Chronic Cancer Pain

The long-term use of opioids is accepted for patients with pain due to malignant disease. Some
degree of tolerance and physical dependence are likely with long-term use. Therefore, before
embarking on opioid therapy, other options should be explored, and the limitations and risks of
opioids should be explained to the patient (For detailed information, refer to Malignant Disease
chapter).

2.0 HEADACHE

A Headache is defined as a pain in the head or upper neck. It is one of the most common
locations of pain in the body and has many causes. There are three major categories of
headaches:

     Primary headaches,
     Secondary headaches, and
     Cranial neuralgias, facial pain, and other headaches
Assessment of headache should be comprehensive for example to include

        Age at onset
        Presence or absence of aura and prodrome

3|Page
        Frequency, intensity and duration of attack
        Number of headache days per month
        Quality, site, and radiation of pain
        Associated symptoms and abnormalities

2.1 Primary headache

Primary headaches include migraine, tension, and cluster headaches, as well as a variety of
other less common types of headache

Migraine Headache
This is characterized by a trial of paroxysmal headache, vomiting and focal neurological events
(usually visual). It is more common in females than in males often there is a family history of
migraine.
Associated precipitants include:-

     Dietary (cheese, chocolate or red wine)
     Psychological stress

General Measures
     Avoidance of precipitants
     Relaxation to reduce stress

Medicines
In acute attack give analgesics:

                   A: Paracetamol 1g immediately then every 4 hours; Max 4g per day
                                       OR

                   A: Aspirin 600mg, repeat after 4 hours if needed.
                                       Plus

                   C: Metroclopramide oral/IM, 10 mg 3 times daily.
In severe attack give:

                   C: Ergotamine tartrate 1-2 mg, maximum 4mg in 24hours, not to be repeated at
                   intervals less than 4 days.
For prevention purposes give:
                   C: Propranolol 80-160mg daily

                                       OR
                   C: Amitryptiline 10-50mg at night.
Referral
     Patient with additional neurological signs or additional risk factors for an alternate
         diagnosis, such as immune deficiency. These patients require brain imaging
     Sudden onset of a first severe headache may indicate serious organic pathology, such
         as subarachnoid hemorrhage
     Acute migraine, not responding to treatment
     Recurrent migraine not controlled with prophylactic therapy

Tension headaches
While tension headaches are the most frequently occurring type of headache, the cause is most
likely contraction of the muscles that cover the skull. When the muscles covering the skull are
stressed, they may spasm and cause pain. Common sites include the base of the skull, the

4|Page
temple and the forehead. Tension headaches occur because of physical or emotional stress
placed on the body.

Diagnosis
     The pain begins in the back of the head and upper neck and is described as a band-like
         tightness or pressure.
     Often is described as pressure encircling the head with the most intense pressure over
         the eyebrows.
     The pain usually is mild (not disabling) and bilateral (affecting both sides of the head).
     The pain is not associated with an aura (see below), nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to
         light and sound.
     The pain occurs sporadically (infrequently and without a pattern) but can occur
         frequently and even daily in some people.
     The pain allows most people to function normally, despite the headache.

    Note:

          The key to making the diagnosis of any headache is the history given by the patient
          If the health care practitioner finds an abnormality, then the diagnosis of tension

              headache would not be considered until the potential for other types of headaches
              have been investigated.

Treatment
Tension headaches are painful, and patients may be upset that the diagnosis is "only" a tension
headache. Even though it is not life-threatening, a tension headache can affect the activities of
daily life. The following work well for most people:

                   A: Aspirin (300-900mg (O) every 4-6 hrs max 4g daily)
                                       OR

                   A: Ibuprofen (1.2-1.8g daily in 3-4 divided doses preferably after food max dose
                   2.4g daily, maintenance dose of 0.6-1.2g daily may be adequate.)

                                       OR
                   A: Paracetamol 1g (O) 8hrly

                                       OR
                   D: Naproxen 0.5-1g in 1-2 divided daily doses
Massage, and stress management can all be used as adjuncts to tension headaches.

     When pain medications are used for a prolonged period of time, headaches can recur as
         the effects of the medication wear off. Thus, the headache becomes a symptom of the
         withdrawal of medication (rebound headache).

Cluster headaches
Cluster headaches are headaches that come in groups (clusters) lasting weeks or months,
separated by pain-free periods of months or years. The cause of cluster headaches is uncertain.
Some evidence shows that brain scans performed on patients who are in the midst of a cluster
headache, shows abnormal activity in the hypothalamus. Cluster headaches:

     May tend to run in families and this suggests that there may be a genetic role
     May be triggered by changes in sleep patterns
     May be triggered by medications (for example, nitroglycerin)

5|Page
If an individual is in a susceptible period for cluster headache, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and
some foods (for example, chocolate) also can be potential causes for headache.

Diagnosis
     Pain typically occurs once or twice daily and last for 30 to 90 minutes
     Attacks tend to occur at about the same time every day
     The pain typically is excruciating and located around or behind one eye. The affected
         eye may become red, inflamed, and watery

    Note: Cluster headaches are much more common in men than women.

Treatment

                   C: Sumatriptan 6mg; Dose may be repeated after 1 hour. Max dose 12mg a day

                                  OR

                   C: 100% Oxygen at the rate of 10-15L/min for 10-20 minutes

Prevention of the next cluster headache may include the following:
                   C: Verapamil 240-960mg (O) 8 -12 hourly divided doses
                                       OR
                   C: Amitryptiline 25-50 mg (O) daily

Prevention cluster headaches
Since cluster headache episodes may be spaced years apart, and since the first headache of a
new cluster episode can't be predicted, daily medication may not be warranted.

Lifestyle changes may help minimize the risk of a cluster headache flare. Stopping smoking and
minimizing alcohol may prevent future episodes of cluster headache.

2.2 Secondary headache

Secondary headaches are due to an underlying disease or injury that needs to be diagnosed
and treated. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential if damage is to be limited
Examples of Secondary headache:

     Head and neck trauma
     Blood vessel problems in the head and neck

         1. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)
         2. Arteriovenous malformations (AVM) may cause headache before they leak
         3. Carotid artery inflammation
         4. Temporal arteritis (inflammation of the temporal artery)

     Non-blood vessel problems of the brain

6|Page
         1. Brain tumors, either primary, or metastatic
         2. Seizures
         3. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, once named pseudo tumor cerebri,

     Medications and drugs (including withdrawal from those drugs)

         Infection
         1. Malaria
         2. Meningitis
         3. Encephalitis
         4. HIV/AIDS
         5. Systemic infections

Diagnosis
     If there is time, the diagnosis of secondary headache begins with a complete patient
         history followed by a physical examination and laboratory and radiology tests as
         appropriate
     However, some patients present in crisis with a decreased level of consciousness or
         unstable vital signs. In these situations, the health care practitioner may decide to treat
         a specific cause without waiting for tests to confirm the diagnosis

3.0 FEVER

Fever known also as pyrexia is a common medical sign of many conditions; characterized by
an elevation of temperature above the normal range of 36.5-37.5oC

Diagnosis/Symptoms
Fever is usually accompanied by sickness behavior such as:

     Depression
     Lethargy
     Anorexia
     Sleepiness
     Hyperalgesia
     Inability to concentrate
     Other symptoms include: feeling cold, increased muscle tone and shivering

Treatment guidelines
Give antipyretic medicines: Paracetamol, Ibuprofen or Aspirin (For dosage, look under pain
section above)

Hyperpyrexia
It is a fever with an extreme elevation of body temperature greater than 41.5o c. Infections are
the most common cause of fevers, however as the temperature rises other causes become
more general.
Note: Hyperpyrexia is considered a medical emergency as it may indicate a serious underlying
conditions.

7|Page
Management
     Keep the patients adequately hydrated as the most significant risk of complications is
         dehydration
     If the temperature reads extremely high, aggressive cooling is required

Treatment
     The antipyretic ibuprofen is effective in reducing fever in children
     Ibuprofen and paracetamol may be used together in children

CAUTION Aspirin is not recommended in children and young adult, under 16 years due to
risk of Reye's syndrome.

4.0 COUGH

Clinical features: Cough is a symptom produced by inflammatory viscid secretions or obstruction
of the tracheobronchial system. It may be dry or productive sputum. Cough may be
paroxysmal, hacking, explosive, and harsh (brassy).

Treatment
Causative/precipitating factors e.g. CCF, asthma; allergies must be established and treated
accordingly. Where causative/precipitating factors cannot be detected, the following treatments
may be offered:

For Non-productive irritating cough
                   A: Cough syrup/Linctus (O) 5-10 ml every 6 hours

Expectorants may be used to liquefy viscid secretions.
                   A: Cough expectorants (O) 5-10 ml every 6 hours

         Note: Antibiotics should never be used routinely in the treatment of cough

5.0 CONVULSION

A convulsion is an episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by abnormal neuronal activity that
results in sudden change in behavior, sensory perception, or motor activity. For a patient with
new onset convulsion the list of possible causes is longer and consists of the following:

     CNS pathologies (stroke,neoplasm,trauma,hypoxia,vascular abnormality)
     Metabolic abnormalities (hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia, hyponatremia/hypernatremia,

         hyercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy
     Toxicological etiologies (alcohol withdrawal, cocaine, isoniazid, theophylline)
     Infectious etiologies(meningitis,encephalitis,brain abcess,neurocycticercosis and malaria)

Approach to a patient:
      Ask for history of epilepsy, if yes; compliance to anticonvulsant
      History of CNS pathology(stroke,neoplasm,recent surgery)
      History of systemic neoplasms,infections,metabollic disorders, or toxic ingestions
      Recent trauma or fall

8|Page
      Alcohol abuse

Special concerns:
     Eclampsia
     Trauma
     Intracranial hemorrhage
     Alcohol or medication withdrawal (barbiturate, diazepam)
     Drug induced seizures(trycyclic antidepressant and isoniazid overdose)

Laboratory studies:
Clinical information should guide the specific workup of a patient. Some investigations must be
ordered:

     Serum glucose level
     Serum electrolyte
     Pregnancy test for women of child bearing age.
     CT scan is indicated as outpatient/inpatient depending on progress of patient after

         episode of seizure.

For a patient who had previously history of seizure do CT scan brain if;
     New focal deficits
     Trauma
     Persistent fever
     New character or pattern to the seizure

ECG should be considered in some patients. Seizure event can be precipitated by cerebral
hypoperfusion due to arrhythmia, ECG may identify the following

      Prolonged QTc
      Widened QRS
      Prominent R in aVR
      Heart block

Consider Lumbar Puncture in;
     Immunocompromised
     Persistent fever
     Severe headache
     Persistently altered mental status

Treatment and management
Neurological dysfunction is theorized to occur after 20mn of continuous seizure, so aggressive
treatment of any seizure should be done in 5 min. always consider the underlying cause until
proved otherwise.

     A, B, C (airway, breathing, circulation)
     Benzodiazepines

                   A: Diazepam 10-20mg IV at a rate of 0.5ml (2.5mg) per 30 sec. Repeat if
                   necessary after 30-60min. May be followed by intravenous infusion to max.

6.0 SHOCK

Shock is a life threatening condition characterized by hypotension. If not treated immediately it
leads to death.

Diagnosis

     Low blood pressure (systolic BP below 80 mmHg) is the key sign of shock
     Weak and rapid pulse
     Rapid and shallow breathe
     Restlessness and altered mental state
     Weakness
     Low urine output

Note
Signs and symptoms of shock in children must be recognized while still in the compensated
state to avoid irreversible deterioration. Therefore, the following are primarily assessed in
children:

     Prolonged capillary filling (more than 3 seconds)
     Decreased pulse volume (weak thread pulse)
     Increased heart rate (>160/minute in infants, > 120 in children)
     Decreased level of consciousness (poor eye contact)
     Rapid breathing
     Decreased blood pressure and decreased urine output are late signs and while they can

         be monitored the above signs are more sensitive in detecting shock before irreversible.

               Caused by an overwhelming infection, leading to
               vasodilatation.

Neurogenic     Caused by trauma to the spinal cord, resulting in    Warm and dry skin
shock          sudden decrease in peripheral vascular
               resistance and hypotension.                          Bronchospasm,
Anaphylactic                                                        angioedema and/or

              I. Emergency treatment

Treatment depends on the type of shock. Intravenous fluid therapy is important in the
treatment of all types of shock except for cardiogenic shock. Prompt diagnosis of underlying
cause is essential to ensure optimal treatment.

     Maintain open airway
     Administer oxygen with face mask and if needed after intubation with assisted

         ventilation
     Check for and manage hypoglycemia

              II. Fluid replacement (Not for Cardiogenic shock)
Adults:

                   A: 0.9% Sodium chloride given as the 1L bolus infusion. Repeat bolus until blood
                   pressure is improved.
         Transfuse blood and plasma expanders (-) in hemorrhagic shock.
Children:
                   A: 0.9% Sodium chloride 20 mol/kg as a slow infusion.
Note

     Do not administer IV fluids in case of Cardiogenic shock but maintain IV access
     If patient develops respiratory distress, discontinue fluids
     Septicemia in children: All children with shock which is not obviously due to trauma or

         simple watery diarrhea should receive antibiotic cover for probable septicemia.

7.0 DEHYDRATION

It is defined as the excessive loss of body fluid. There are three types of dehydration: hypotonic
or hyponatremic (primarily a loss of electrolytes, sodium in particular), hypertonic or
hypernatremic (primarily a loss of water), and isotonic or isonatremic (equal loss of water and
electrolytes). In humans, the most commonly seen type of dehydration by far is isotonic
(isonatraemic) dehydration which effectively equates with Hypovolemic, but the distinction of
isotonic from hypotonic or hypertonic dehydration may be important when treating people who
become dehydrated. Physiologically, dehydration, despite the name, does not simply mean loss
of water, as water and solutes (mainly sodium) are usually lost in roughly equal quantities to
how they exist in blood plasma. In hypotonic dehydration, intravascular water shifts to the extra
vascular space, exaggerating intravascular volume depletion for a given amount of total body
water loss. Neurological complications can occur in hypotonic and hypertonic states. The former
can lead to seizures, while the latter can lead to osmotic cerebral edema upon rapid
rehydration.

Hypovolemic
Hypovolemic is specifically a decrease in volume of blood plasma. It defines water deficiency
only in terms of volume rather than specifically water.

Signs and symptoms
Symptoms may include headaches similar to what is experienced during a hangover, a sudden
episode of visual snow, and dizziness or fainting when standing up due to orthostatic
hypotension. Untreated dehydration generally results in delirium, unconsciousness, swelling of
the tongue and, in extreme cases, death.

Thirst, dryness of mucous membrane, loss of skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension or
tachycardia, reduced jugular venous pressure (JVP) or central venous pressure (CVP) and
decreased urine output. In the presence of normal renal function dehydration is associated
usually with a urine output of less than 0.5ml kg/hr.

Differential diagnosis

12 | P a g e
In humans, dehydration can be caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair
water homeostasis in the body. These include:

     External or stress-related causes

  o           Prolonged physical activity with sweating without consuming adequate water,

     especially in a hot and/or dry environment

  o           Prolonged exposure to dry air, e.g., in high-flying airplanes (5%­12% relative

     humidity)

  o           Blood loss or hypotension due to physical trauma

  o           Diarrhea

  o           Hyperthermia

  o           Shock (hypovolemic)

  o           Vomiting

  o           Burns

  o           Lacrimation

  o           Use of methamphetamine, amphetamine, caffeine and other stimulants

  o           Excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages

     Infectious diseases (Refer to gastrointestinal chapter for details)

              o Cholera

              o Gastroenteritis

              o Shigellosis

              o Yellow fever

     Malnutrition

  o           Electrolyte disturbance

              o Hypernatremia (also caused by dehydration)

              o Hyponatremia, especially from restricted salt diets

  o           Fasting

  o           Recent rapid weight loss may reflect progressive depletion of fluid volume (the

     loss of 1 L of fluid results in a weight loss of 1 kg (2.2 lb)).

  o           Patient refusal of nutrition and hydration

  o           Inability to swallow (obstruction of the esophagus)

Other causes of obligate water loss

     Severe hyperglycemia, especially in diabetes mellitus

  o           Glycosuria

  o           Uremia

     Diabetes insipidus

     Acute emergency dehydration event

     Food borne illness

Tests include:

   Blood chemistries (to check electrolytes, especially sodium, potassium, and
      bicarbonate levels)

   Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)

13 | P a g e
   Complete blood count (CBC)
   Creatinine
   Urine specific gravity

Other tests may be done to determine the cause of the dehydration (for example, blood sugar
level to check for diabetes).

Treatment

For some dehydration oral fluid is the most effective to replenish fluid deficit.

In more severe cases, correction of fluid deficit is best by intravenous therapy. Solutions used
for intravenous rehydration must be isotonic or hypotonic.

For severe cases of dehydration where fainting, unconsciousness, or other severely inhibiting
symptom is present (the patient is incapable of standing or thinking clearly), emergency
attention is required. Fluids containing a proper balance of replacement electrolytes are given
intravenously with continuing assessment of electrolyte status.

8.0 HYPOGLYCEMIA

Hypoglycemia is a condition of lower than normal level of blood glucose.

Criteria referred to as Whipple's triad are used to determine a diagnosis of hypoglycemia:

  1. Symptoms known to be caused by hypoglycemia
  2. Low glucose at the time the symptoms occur
  3. Reversal or improvement of symptoms or problems when the glucose is restored to

      normal

Symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until the blood sugar is in the level of 2.8 to
3.0 mmol/L (50 to 54 mg/dl). The precise level of glucose considered low enough to define
hypoglycemia is dependent on (1) the measurement method, (2) the age of the person, (3)
presence or absence of effects, and (4) the purpose of the definition.

Signs and symptoms
Hypoglycemic symptoms and manifestations can be divided into those produced by the counter
regulatory hormones (epinephrine/adrenaline and glucagon) triggered by the falling glucose,
and the neuroglycopenic effects produced by the reduced brain sugar.

Adrenergic manifestations

  Shakiness, anxiety, nervousness

  Palpitations, tachycardia

  Sweating, feeling of warmth (although sweat glands have muscarinic receptors, thus

  "adrenergic manifestations" is not entirely accurate)

  Pallor, coldness, clamminess

  Dilated pupils (mydriasis)

14 | P a g e
  Feeling of numbness "pins and needles" (paresthesia)

Glucagon manifestations

  Hunger, borborygmus

  Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort

  Headache

Neuroglycopenic manifestations

  Abnormal mentation, impaired judgment

  Personality change, emotional liability

  Fatigue, weakness, apathy, lethargy, daydreaming, sleep

  Confusion, amnesia, dizziness, delirium

  Stupor, coma, abnormal breathing

  Generalized or focal seizures

Causes

The circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Circumstances
include the age of the patient, time of day, time since last meal, previous episodes, nutritional
status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxins (especially insulin or other diabetes
drugs), diseases of other organ systems, family history, and response to treatment. When
hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly, a record or "diary" of the spells over several months, noting
the circumstances of each spell (time of day, relation to last meal, nature of last meal, response
to carbohydrate, and so forth) may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the
hypoglycemia.

Glucose requirements above 10 mg/kg/minute in infants, or 6 mg/kg/minute in children and
adults are strong evidence for hyperinsulinism. In this context this is referred to as the glucose
infusion rate (GIR).

Finally, the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help
distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia. A rise of blood glucose by more than
30 mg/dl (1.70mmol/l) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia.

For patients who have recurrent hypoglycemia's the following tests might be needed depending
on the history and physical examination: insulin, cortisol, and electrolytes, with C-peptide and
drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children.

Treatment
Management of hypoglycemia involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal,
determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes.

The blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking 10-20 grams of
carbohydrate. It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow.
This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 100-120 ml of orange juice or non-diet soda.
Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking acarbose), but adding fat or
protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full

15 | P a g e
recovery may take 10­20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has
diabetes will simply produce hyperglycemia afterwards.
If unconscious or for other reasons can not feed orally secure an IV line and give intravenous
dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%,
children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in
giving these solutions because they can be very necrotic if the IV is infiltrated. If an IV cannot
be established, the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an intramuscular
injection.
One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is
taking acarbose. Since acarbose and other alpha-glucosidase inhibitors prevents starch and
other sugars from being broken down into monosaccharide's that can be absorbed by the body,
patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as
glucose powder, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.
(For other details, refer to Hypoglycemia, under Endocrine and Metabolic Disease
conditions' chapter thirteen)

                    ORAL AND DENTAL CONDITION

Oral disease conditions are common and range from dental caries, periodontal conditions,
dental abscess and other acute bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, traumatic
injuries and tumors. The lesions affecting the maxillofacial region (perioral, jaws and face) are
also considered here but for a more detail a relevant text book or manual need to be referred.
The clinician should be able tqo identify conditions requiring immediate attention by the dentist,
do the preliminary urgent and life saving measures where possible before referring the patient
to a centre with a dentist/dental surgeon. There are some cases which will need the attention
of a specialist dental surgeon (like oral and maxillofacial surgeon, orthodontist e.t.c) but in most
cases these will be identified by a general dentist.

1. 0 PERIODONTAL CONDITIONS

1.1 Gingivitis

Inflammatory changes in the gingival develop within a couple of days of undisturbed bacterial
growth on the cervical portion of the tooth surface.

Diagnostic criteria:

 Inflammation of the gingival which is initially seen as discrete colour and texture

changes of the marginal tissues.

 After few days of plaque accumulation     overt gingivitis is established, characterized

by gingival redness and swelling and increased tendency of the gingival to bleed on

gentle probing, during tooth brushing or even on touch.

Prevention
Instructions for proper oral hygiene care

Treatment
Removal of accumulated plaque and oral hygiene instructions on tooth brushing and other
adjuvant means of oral hygiene (dental flossing, use of mouth washes)

1.2 Periodontitis

This is the progression of the inflammation of gingivitis into the deep tissue affecting the
periodontal membrane causing periodontal pockets, introduction of infection and destruction of
periodontium. The damage of the periodontal membrane, periodontal ligaments and eventually
alveolar bone leads to formation of pockets which eventually favours more bacterial growth. As
the destruction continues the teeth become loose and may eventually fall out.

Diagnostic Criteria
     Reddened, swollen gingiva
     Easily bleeding gingival on gently probing
     Loose/mobile teeth
     Bad breath from the mouth

17 | P a g e
     Gingival recession
     Periodontal pocket

Investigation: Mainly X-ray (orthopantomogram (OPG)) to determine extent of bone loss

Prevention and Non Pharmacological Treatment
     Instruction and guidance to the patients on proper oral hygiene for proper plaque
         control
     Plaque control by the dentists by scaling and root planning (this may need several visits
         as may be found necessary)
     Advanced treatment ­ if refractory/resistant to treatment or patient has systemic
         diseases conditions.

Note: Patients with systemic diseases conditions like diabetes mellitus, liver and renal diseases,
HIV/AIDS and those who are pregnant or heavy smokers of cigarette are generally at increased
risk of periodontal diseases and their management may need referral to a periodontal specialist

Pharmacological treatment
     Mouth washes:
                   A: Hydrogen peroxide 3% 3-4 times daily
                                       OR
                   A: Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% 3-4 times daily
                                       OR
                   A: Povidone iodine 0.5% used 3-4 times daily will argument the plaque control
                   treatment.
         Use antibiotics only for severe cases and those with evidence of periodontal abscess
         formation:
                   A: Metronidazole (O) 400mg 8 hourly for 5 days
                                       Plus
                   A: Amoxicillin 500 mg 8 hourly for 5 days
                                       OR
                   A: Tetracycline 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days.

  Note: Tetracycline should not be given to pregnant and lactating mothers to
  avoid tetracycline stains in for their babies.

1.3 Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG)

It is a severe form of gingivitis and it characterized by rapid destruction of gingival tissue,
particularly in the area of the interdental papilla. Patients usually present with soreness and
bleeding of the gums and foul test (fetor-ex ore). Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG)
is also called Vincent's gingivitis or Vincent's gingivostomatitis. It is common in malnourished
children and immunocompromized individuals especially patients with diabetes and HIV/AIDS.

18 | P a g e
Diagnostic criteria
   Painful and easily bleeding gingival swelling and erythema of the gingival margins
   Yellowish-white ulceration of the gingival
   Fever, malaise and regional lymphadenitis
   In some patients (especially malnourished children), ANUG may presents with extensive
       destruction of the face and jaws in the severe form known as Cancrum Oris or noma

Treatment
     Professional cleaning with Hydrogen Peroxide 3% (under local anesthesia)

                   A: Metronidazole 400 mg (O) 8 hourly a day for five days

                   A: Amoxicillin 500mg (O) 6 hourly for 5 days

1.4 Stomatitis

This is generalized inflammation of the oral mucosal (including the gingiva) due to different
aetiologies. Such aetiologies include infections, chemical burn, radiations. Contact stomatitis (a
counterpart of contact dermatitis) also can occur due to allergy.

Diagnosis

2.0 DENTAL CARIES

It is a condition whereby the tooth is demineralized by acid which is produced by bacteria in the
process of metabolizing sugar. Start slowly with white spots later developing to black/brown
spot and cavities in enamel, dentine and eventually the pulp. Dental caries is caused by bacteria
of the dental plaque which feed on sugary food substrates producing acid as by-products which
dissolve the minerals of the tooth surface. The bacteria which cause dental caries are mainly of
streptococcus (S.mutans, S. viridians)

Diagnostic Criteria
     Early stage ­ asymptomatic
     Intermediate stage:- black/brown spot which may be visible on any surface of tooth
     Cavities developing on tooth surface
     Pain/toothache elicited by hot, cold or sweet foods/drinks
     Late stage: pain may be spontaneous, intermittent, sharp and severe, even interfering
         with sleep.
     There is tenderness on percussion of the tooth.

     X-Rays: Periapical x-ray of tooth/teeth may need to be done especially to confirm extent
         of caries for treatment decision e.g. the caries contained in the dentine can be
         distinguished from pulpal caries.

Note: The Susceptible sites are those areas where plaque accumulation can occur and be
hidden to escape active and passive cleansing mechanisms e.g. pits and fissures of the
posterior teeth, interproximal surfaces and teeth in malocclusion.

Prevention

     Proper instruction to avoid frequent use of sugary foods and drinks

     Use fluoridated toothpaste to brush teeth at least once a day

Non-pharmacological measures

     Early lesions presenting as a spot on enamel without cavitation and softening, observe
         and adhering to preventive measures.

     Lesion with cavitation but confined to dentine ­ filling/restoration of teeth with suitable
         filling materials (e.g. amalgam, composite, glass ionomer)

     Lesion involving the pulp (with or without periapical abscess), perform advanced tooth
         restoration by endodontic treatment wherever possible otherwise tooth extraction is
         done.

3.0 ODONTOGENIC AND NON-ODONTOGENIC OROFACIAL INFECTIONS

3.1 Periapical Abscess

The clinical presentation arises as a complication of inflammation of the dental pulp or
periodontal pocket. The condition may be acute and diffuse or chronic with fistula or localized
and circumscribed. It is located in the apical aspect of the supporting bone.

Diagnosis
     The patient complain tooth ache
     Pain during intake of hot or cold foods/drinks
     Pain on bringing the tooth on occlusion
     Tenderness on percussion (vertical percussion)
     Swelling of gingiva around the affected tooth

Treatment
     For posterior teeth: Extraction of the offending tooth under local anesthesia

         Lignocaine 2% with adrenaline 1:80,000 IU (to establish drainage) is the treatment of
         choice followed by analgesics.

         Adult: Paracetamol (O) 500mg ­ 1g, 4-6 hourly for 3 days, Child: Paracetamol (O) 10-15
         mg/kg 4-6 hourly

     For anterior teeth (incisors, canine and premolars: Extraction is carried out only when
         root canal treatment is not possible. Give antibiotics:

    Adult

                   A: Amoxicillin (O) 500mg, 8 hourly for 5-7 days;

                   Children, Amoxicillin (O) 25 mg/kg in 3 divided doses for 5 days.

21 | P a g e
                   Children 7-10 years, 100mg every 8 hour

Note: Periodontal abscess is located in the coronal aspect of the supporting bone associated
with a periodontal pocket.

3.2 Infected Socket

A post extraction complication due to infection of the clot due to contamination (infected
socket). The condition is painful and if not managed well could lead to osteomylitis.

Diagnostic criteria
     Severe painful socket 2-4 days after tooth extraction
     Fever
     Necrotic blood clot in the socket
     Swollen gingiva around the socket
     Sometimes there may be lymphodenopathy and trismus (Inability to open the mouth)

Treatment
     Under local anesthesia with Lignocaine 2% socket debridement and irrigation with
         Hydrogen peroxide 3%. The procedure of irrigation is repeated the 2nd and 3rd day and
         where necessary can be extended to 4th day if pain persists. On follow-up visits local
         anesthesia is avoided unless necessary.
     Patient is instructed to rinse with warm saline (5ml spoonful salt in 200mls cup of warm
         water) or 3% hydrogen peroxide 3-4 times a day
     Antibiotics prescribed to prevent progression to osteomylitis:
                             A: Amoxicillin 500mg (O) 6 hourly for 5 days
                                        Plus
                             A: Metronidazole 400mg 8 hourly for 5 days.
     X-Ray: Periapical X-ray of the socket may be necessary when there are poor progression
         apart from the above treatment, aim is to check where there are no root remnant,
         foreign body or any local bone pathology

    Referral: is center with maxillofacial unit is considered in case of persistent pain and
    infection apart from treatment for more than two weeks

3.3 Dry Socket

It is a post extraction complication due to failure to form clot (dry socket). The condition is very
painful and it defers from infected socket by lack of clot and its severity of pain.

Diagnosis
     Severe pain 2-4 days post-extraction
     Pain exacerbated by entry of air on the site
     Socket devoid of clot
     It is surrounded by inflamed gingiva

Treatment

22 | P a g e
Treatment is under local anesthesia with Lignocaine 2% socket debridement and irrigation of
hydrogen peroxide 3%. The procedure of irrigation is repeated the 2nd and 3rd day and where
necessary can be extended to 4th day if pain persists. On follow-up visits local anesthesia is
avoided unless necessary.

3.4 Dental Abscess

Dental abscess is an acute lesion characterizes by localization of pus in the structures that
surround the teeth. Dental abscess is a polymicrobial infection. Aerobic Gram positive cocci and
anaerobic Gram negative rods predominate among others. The predominant species include;
Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Streptococcus viridians.

Diagnosis
     Fever and chills
     Throbbing pain of the offending tooth
     Swelling of the gingiva and sounding tissues
     Pus discharge around the gingiva of affected tooth/teeth
     Trismus (Inability to open the mouth)
     Regional lymphnodes enlargement and tender
     Aspiration of pus for frank abscess

Investigations: Pus for Grams stain, culture and sensitivity and where necessary, perform full
blood count.
Treatment
Preliminaries

     Determine the severity of the infection
     Evaluate the status of the patient's host defence mechanism
     Determine the need of referral to dentist/oral surgeon early enough

Non-pharmacological
     Incision and drainage and irrigation (irrigation and dressing is repeated daily)
     Irrigation is done with 3% hydrogen peroxide followed by rinse with normal saline.
     Supportive therapy carried out depending on the level of debilitation (most patients
         need rehydration and detoxification)

Pharmacology
Drug of choice:

                   A: Amoxicillin 500mg (O) 6 hourly for 5 days
                                       Plus

                   A: Metronidazole 400 mg (O) 8 hourly for 5 days.
     Second choice/ severe case

                   C: Amoxicillin with Clavulanic acid 625mg (O) 12 hourly for 5 days
                                       Plus

                   A: Metronidazole 400 mg (O) 8 hourly for 5 days.

23 | P a g e
         If allergic to penicillin's:
                   A: Erythromycin 500 mg (O) 8 hourly for 5 days

Where parenteral administration of antibiotics is necessary (especially when the patient can not
swallow and has life threatening infection, consider

                   C: Ampicillin 500mg IM/IV 6 hourly for 5 days
                                       OR

                   C: Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV once daily for 5 days
                                       Plus

                   C: Metronidazole 500 mg IV 8 hourly for 5 days
    Note: Incision and drainage is mandatory in cases of deeper spaces involvement followed
    by a course of antibiotics. The practice of prescribing antibiotics to patients with abscess
    and denying referral for definitive care until pus has establishes or resolved has found to
    lead to more problems for orofacial infections THEREFORE early referral for definitive care
    is important.

Criteria for referral
     Rapidly progressive infection
     Difficulty in breathing
     Difficulty swallowing
     Fascia space involvement
     Elevated body temperature [greater than 39 C)
     Severe jaw trismus/failure to open the mouth (less than 10mm)
     Toxic appearance
     Compromised host defenses

3.5 Ludwig's Angina

It is a serious life threatening generalized septic cellulitis of the fascia spaces found on the floor
of the mouth and tongue. It is an extension of infection from mandibular molar teeth into the
floor of the mouth covering the submandibualr spaces bilaterally sublingual and submental
spaces.

Diagnosis
     Brawny induration
     Tissues are swollen, board like and not pit and no fluctuance
     Respiratory distress
     Dysphagia
     Tissues may become gangrenous with a peculiar lifeless appearance on cutting
     Three fascia spaces are involved bilaterally (submandibular, submental and sublingual)

Treatment
Non-Pharmacological

     Quick assessment of airway

24 | P a g e
     Incision and drainage is done (even in absence of pus) to relieve the pressure and allow
         irrigation.

     Only when the airway distress is significant and there is evidence that it is not relieved
         by incision and drainage then tracheostomy is needed

     Supportive care include high protein diet and fluids for rehydration, detoxification and

Pharmacological

                   C: Ampicillin 500 mg IV 6 hourly for 5 days
                                       Plus

                   C:Metronidazole 500mg IV 8 hourly for 5 days
         If allergic to penicillin use

                   A: Erythromycin (O) 500 mg 6 hourly for 5 days
                                       OR

                   C: Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV once a day for 5 days in case of severe infection
         Once the patient is able to swallow the oral replace IV drugs.

Note: For this condition and other life threatening oral conditions consultation of available
specialists (especially oral and maxillofacial surgeons) should go parallel with life saving
measures.

3.6 Pericoronitis

Inflammation of the soft tissues covering the crown of erupting tooth and occurs more
commonly in association with the mandibular third molar (wisdom) teeth. Impaction of food and
plaque under the gingiva flap provide a medium for bacterial multiplication. Biting on the gum
flap by opposing tooth causes laceration of the flap, increasing the infection and swelling. Then
more likelihood of traumatic biting, this may lead to a vicious cycle. Involved bacteria are similar
to those causing gingivitis and periodontitis.

Diagnosis
     High temperature,
     Severe malaise
     Discomfort in swallowing and chewing
     Well localized dull pain, swollen and tender gum flap
     Signs of partial tooth eruption or uneruption in the region
     Pus discharge beneath the flap may or may not be observed
     Foetor-ox oris bad smell
     Trismus
     Regional lymphnodes enlargement and tender

Treatment
                   A: Hydrogen peroxide solution 3% irrigation

If does not help, or from initial assessment the situation was found to require more than that
then;

25 | P a g e
     Excision of the operculum/flap (flapectomy) is done under local anesthesia

     Extraction of the third molar associated with the condition

     Other means include: Grinding or extraction of the opposing tooth

     Use analgesics
     Consider use antibiotics especially when there are features infection like painful mouth

         opening and trismus, swelling, lymphadenopathy and fever.

         Drug of choice
                   A: Amoxicillin 500mg (O) 6 hourly for 5 days
                                       Plus
                   A: Metronidazole 400 mg (O) 8 hourly for 5 days

         If severe (rarely) refer section 3.4 on treatment of dental abscess

3.7 Osteomyelitis of the Jaw

It is an inflammation of the medullary portion of the jaw bone which extends to involve the
periosteum of the affected area. The infection becomes established in the bone ending up with
pus formation in the medullary cavity or beneath the periosteum obstructs the blood supply.
The infected bone becomes necrotic following ischemia.

Diagnosis
     In the initial stage there is no swelling. The patient has malaise and fever

     There is enlargement of regional lymphnodes.

     The teeth in the affected area become painful and loose, thus causing difficulty in
         chewing.

     Later as the bone undergoes necrosis the area becomes very painful and swollen.

     Pus ruptures through the periosteum into the muscular and subcutaneous fascia.

     Eventually it is discharged on to the skin surface through a sinus.

Investigation: X-ray ­ OPG (Orthopantomograph ) or mandibular lateral oblique, water's view
for maxilla/midface. The x-ray will show sequestra formation in chronic stage. In early stage
features seen in x-ray include widening of periodontal spaces, changes in bone trabeculation
and areas of radioluscency. Perform culture and sensitivity of the pus to detect the specific
bacteria.

Treatment
Non-pharmacological

     Incision and adequate drainage to confirmed pus accumulation which is accessible
     Culture should be taken to determine the sensitivity of the causative organisms

26 | P a g e
     Removal of the sequestrum is by surgical intervention (sequestrectomy) is done after
         the formation of sequestrum has been confirmed by X-ray.

Pharmacological
                   A: Amoxicillin or cloxacillin 500mg 6 hourly
                                       Plus
                   A: Metronidazole 400mg gram 8 hourly before getting the culture and sensitivity
                   then change according to results.

                             For details on antibiotics see section 3.4
     Antibiotic therapy may be continued for about 1-3 months.
     Referral is recommended to a zonal referral hospital for any case with long standing

         pus discharge and sinuses from the jaws

4.0 FUNGAL INFECTIONS

Oral Candidiasis (Thrush)

This is a fungal infection of the oral mucosa caused by Candidal infection mainly Candida
albicans. Candida albicans is yeast and is a normal oral commensally. Under certain
circumstances candida becomes pathogenic producing both acute and chronic infection. Acute
oral candidiasis (Thrush) is seen most commonly in the malnourished, the severely ill, neonates
and HIV-AIDS patients or patients on long term oral corticosteroids use. In chronic oral
candidiasis dense white plaques of keratin are formed. Other risks for candidiasis is chronic
diseases like diabetes mellitus, prolonged use of antibiotics and ill/poorly fitting dentures.

Diagnosis

Feature of candidiasis are divided according to the types
Pseudomembranous

     White creamy patches/plaque
     Cover any portion of mouth but more on tongue, palate and buccal mucosa

     Sometimes may present as erythematous type whereby bright erythematous mucosal
         lesions with only scattered white patches/plaques

Hyperplastic

White patches leukoplakia-like which is not easily rubbed-off.

Angular cheilitis (angular stomatitis)
     Soreness, erythema and fissuring at the angles of the mouth
     It is commonly associated with denture stomatitis but may represent a nutritional
         deficiency or it may be related to orofacial granulomatosis or HIV infection
     Investigation where available: For confirmation cytologic smear in solution of 20%
         potassium hydroxide for microscopy to see typical hyphae

Treatment

              B: Nystatin (suspension) 100,000 IU (1 ml) mixture held in the mouth before
              swallowing, 4 times a day (after each feed).

                                 OR
              C: Miconazole (O) gel 25 mg/ml 5-10 mls in mouth ­hold it before swallowing.

27 | P a g e
         The treatment is continued for 5 days after cure/clearance

         Where topical application has failed or candidal infection has been considered severe
         add

                   B: Fluconazole (O) 150mg once daily for 7-14days
                                       OR

                   C: Ketoconazole (O) 400mg once daily for 7 days is reserved only for severe
         cases

    Note: Candidiasis has several risk factors; it is recommended that for HIV/AIDS patients
    with candidiasis the HIV guidelines should be referred.

5.0 VIRAL INFECTIONS

Herpes Simplex Virus
It is a viral infection commonly affecting the lips and perioral soft tissues presenting as
papulovesicular lesions which ultimately ulcerate. The condition is recurrent following a primary
herpes infection which occurs during childhood leaving herpes simplex viruses latent in the
trigeminal ganglia. The primary infection affects mainly the gingiva and palate.

Diagnosis
     A prodrome of tingling, warmth or itching at the site usually precedes the recurrence
     About 12 hours later, redness appears followed by papules and then vesicles
     These vesicles then burst, weep, dry, scab and then heal
     The length of the cycle is variable (5-12 days mean time being 7 days)
     There are no investigation required unless patient has systemic diseases

Treatment
Non Pharmacological Treatment

     Adequate hydration
     Avoid salty and acidy drinks
     Cover lesions on the lips with Petroleum jelly and control any underlying cause

Pharmacological treatment
The disease is otherwise self-limiting condition but sometimes may need drug treatment

Herpes labial
                   B: Acyclovir Cream apply 4 hourly for 5 days

28 | P a g e
         Herpes Stomatitis

                   B: Acyclovir 200mg 5 times in 24 hours for 5 days

         In immunocompromised

                   B: Acyclovir 400mg 5 times in 24 hours for 5 days

         Pain control by analgesics

                   A: Paracetamol 1000mg 8 hourly for 3 days

                                       OR

                   A: Ibuprofen 400 mg 8 hourly for 3 days

For oral facial lesions of herpes zoster treat with
                   B: Acyclovir 400 - 800mg 5 times a day for 5 days.

Treatment may require analgesics, topical acyclovir (DOSE AS ABOVE)

6.0 APHTHOUS ULCERATION

Alphthous ulcers or recurrent alphthous stomatitis (RAS) are painful recurrent mucous
membrane ulcerations. Usually affect the non-keratinized oral mucous membrane.

Diagnosis
There are 3 types of alphthous ulcers

    Minor alphthous ulcers
 Small round or ovoid ulcers 2-4 mm in diameter.
 Surrounded by an erythematous halo and some edema
 Occur in groups of only a few ulcers (i.e., 1-6) at a time
 Found mainly on the non keratinized mobile mucosa of the lips, cheeks, floor of the mouth,

    sulci, or ventrum of the tongue
 Heal spontaneously in 7-10 days.
 Leave little or no evidence of scarring

Major Alphthous ulcers
Painful ulcers on non-keratinized oral mucous membrane, they are large 1-3 cm edged ulcers,
and several may be present simultaneously. There is marked tissue destruction which is
sometimes constantly present. Healing is prolonged often with scarring

Herpetiform ulcers
These occur in a group of multiple ulcers which are small (1-5 mm) and heal within 7-10 days
Rationale of treatment: To offer symptomatic treatment for pain, and discomfort, especially
when ulcers are causing problems with eating

29 | P a g e
Treatment

           A: Prednisolone 20 mg tid for 3 days then dose tapered to 10 mg tid for 2 days
           then 5 mg tid for other 2 days.

                                        OR
           S: Topical triamcinolone in base used twice daily

                                        Plus
           A: Paracetamol 1 gm 8 hourly for three days

IDEAL: Oral gel containing ant inflammatory agent preferably combined with analgesic and
antiseptic.

Referral criteria: If the ulcers persist for more than 3 weeks apart from treatment, such
lesion may need histological diagnosis after specialist opinion.

7.0 POST EXTRACTION BLEEDING

Commonly due to disturbing the blood clot by the patient through rinsing or inadequate
compression on the gauze, though at times may be due to bony/tooth remnants.
Diagnosis
Bleeding socket can be primary (occurring within first 24 hours post extraction) or secondary
occurring beyond 24 hours post extraction.

Primary bleeding socket
 Active bleeding from the socket
 The socket may or may not have blood clot
 Patient may be dehydrated and pale if has lost significant amount of blood
 Features of decreased pulse rate and volume, hypotension also if has lost significant

        amount of blood
 Examine well the socket may be having traumatic area of surrounding bone of the socket

Secondary bleeding socket may show features of infection or trauma

Treatment Guidelines
     After quick survey make sure the patient airway, breathing and circulation are restored if
         there were derangements
     Check Blood pressure and pulse rate and take quick history
     Give Local anesthesia (lignocaine 2% with adrenaline 1 in 80,000 IU)
     Clear any clot available and examine the socket to identify source of bleeding
     If the bleeding was from soft tissue (which is common) remove any foreign body like
         bone spicule if found, smoothen any sharp edges
     Suturing of the wound only when necessary (like significantly traumatize gingiva)
     Check and repack the socket with gauze.
     Give proper instructions to follow (bite on gauze pack for 30 minutes, not to rinse or eat
         hot foods on that day at least of 12 hours and avoid disturbance to the wound)

Packing can be done by material which stimulate blood clotting like oxidized cellulose (e.g.
surgicel/gauze) or Thrombin containing gel foam sponges

30 | P a g e
Medication may be needed especially analgesics example [Paracetamol/diclofenac/ibuprofen]
and

                   D: Tranexamic acid 500 mg (O/IV) 8 hourly for first 24 hours.

Intravenous fluid especially Normal saline 0.9% or Ringer's lactate in case of dehydration then
followed by blood transfusion in case of hemoglobin below 7 g/dl in a patient who was
otherwise healthy before tooth extract

         Rule out bleeding disorders: if bleeding continued after 24 hours despite steps above,
         consult a hematologist or available physician for further management

8.0 TOOTH SENSITIVITIES

Usually is due to attrition of teeth, abrasion or gingival recession
Treatment
Self care: Tooth brushing with toothpaste for sensitive teeth.
Professional care:

                             C: Fluoride Gel application

9.0 TOOTH ERUPTION, SHEDDING AND EDENTULOUSNESS

9.1 Eruption of Teeth

Eruption of deciduous /primary teeth usually starts at five months of age. Symptoms associated
with it like fever and diarrhea are normal and self limiting unless any other causes can be
established. The following conditions usually are associated with tooth eruption and should be
referred to dental personnel: eruption cysts, gingival cysts of the newborn and pre/natal teeth.
NOTE: There is nothing like "nylon teeth" what is a myth/believe existing in some traditions
instead there are various above mentioned conditions associated with eruption of
deciduous/primary teeth

9.2 Shedding of Deciduous/Primary (Milk) Teeth

Phenomenon of loosing of deciduous/primary teeth occurring between aged of 5-12 years is
normal physiological changes. Deciduous/primary teeth should be left to fall out on themselves
unless the teeth are carious or there is any other indication. Parents should be counseled
accordingly and be instructed to assist their children to loosen the teeth the already mobile
teeth and when there is no success or the permanent teeth are erupting in wrong direction
should consult a dentist. Most of carious teeth will need management by a dentist. Early loss of
primary teeth may lead to crowding of permanent teeth.

9.3 Edentulousness

It is the partial or full loss of natural teeth and subsequent resorption of the alveolar bone.

Treatment: It is by designing and constructing dental prosthesis according to aesthetic and
functional needs. Materials to be used are many and include: alginate impression materials,
calcium chloride powered, acrylic and porcelain, (refer NEMLIT for dental supplies)

10.0 MALOCCLUSIONS

Malocclusion is any variation in the arrangement of teeth leading to abnormal occlusion to the
extent that may be functionally harmful or aesthetically objectionable.

Diagnosis
There are several forms of malocclusion

Class 1
The sagittal arch relationship is normal. The anterior buccal groove of the lower permanent
molar should occlude with the anterior buccal cusp of the upper first permanent molar.
Class II
The lower arch is at least one half a cusp widths too far distal to the upper.
Class III
The lower arch is at least one half a cusp widths too far mesial to the upper.

Treatment
Rationale for treatment:

     Reduce possibility of temporomandibular joint pain dysfunction syndrome especially in
         case of cross bites

     Reduce risks of traumatic dental injuries especially in overjet
     Traumatic occlusion and gum diseases and caries especially in crowing
     Avoid psychosocial effects resulting from to lack of self esteem, self confidence personal

         outlook and sociocultural acceptability

Removable orthodontic appliances are those designed to be removed by the patient then
replaced back. They are very useful in our local settings especially for mild to moderate
malocclusion in teenagers.

Appliances for active tooth movement fall into two groups
         Simple removable appliances which have mechanical a component to move the
                 teeth
         Myofuctional appliances, which harness the forces generated by the orofacial
                 muscles.

Passive removable appliances may also save two functions:

              Retainers used to hold the teeth following active tooth movement

              Space maintainers, used to prevent space loss following the extraction of teeth.

Fixed orthodontic appliances (braces) are useful in malocclusion which have resulted in
relapses of failure after use of removable appliances and moderate to severe malocclusion
which can not be managed by removable appliances especially adult patients. Adolescents and
adult patients requiring fixed appliances should be referred to an orthodontist.

32 | P a g e
Preventive orthodontic treatment by serial preventive extraction to create a space for anterior
permanent teeth can be done by qualified dental personnel, if in he/she is in doubt it is
recommended to consult dental specialist available.

11.0 TRAUMATIC DENTAL INJURIES

It may result to loosening, displacement and or loss of teeth, fracture of teeth and or bone,
lacerations and bleeding. The commonest causes are alls (in sports and play) at home or
school and motor accidents. Most affected are teeth upper incisors.

Table 1: Diagnosis  Presentation
Type
                    Injury to supporting tissues of tooth, without displacement.
Tooth Concussion    partial displacement, but is commonly used to describe
Subluxation         loosening of a tooth without displacement
                    Displacement of tooth (laterally, labially, or palatally).
Luxation            Displacement of tooth into its socket. Often accompanied by
Intrusion           fracture of alveolar bone
                    Complete loss of the tooth from the socket
Avulsion

Soft tissue injuries
Abrasion: does a friction between an object and the surface of the soft tissue cause a wound.
This wound is usually superficial, denudes the epithelium, and occasionally involves deeper
layer.
Contusion: is more commonly called a bruised and indicates that some amount of tissue
disruption has occurred within the tissues, which resulted in subcutaneous or sub mucosal
hemorrhage without a break in the soft tissue surface.
Laceration: is a tear in the epithelial and sub epithelial tissues. It is perhaps the most frequent
type of soft tissue injury, is caused most commonly by a sharp object

Treatment
 Give tetanus toxoid (0.5% IU)
 Check for facial fractures and trauma to other sites, rule out evidence of head Injury

    (amnesia, loss of consciousness, neurological signs)
 Intra-oral examination: Look for soft-tissue lacerations, dentoalveolar fractures and damage

    to teeth.
 Check for tooth fragments which may be displaced in soft tissues
 Examine traumatized teeth for mobility and check mobility
 X-rays: (periapical x-ray) especially for suspected root fracture, and OPG x-ray for

    suspected alveolar bone fracture and jaw fracture
 Suture for any soft tissue wounds
 Wash mouth with warm saline solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Repeat mouth

    wash3 times daily.
 Medication prescribed for elimination of pain; give analgesic (paracetamol or diclofenac or

    ibuprofen).
 Give prophylactic antibiotics if indicated. Antibiotic cover in cases of suspected

    contamination or extensive damage (Amoxicillin (oral) 500 mg 8hrly for 5 days).

33 | P a g e
 Efforts should be made to save the permanent tooth unless there is root fracture.
    Restoration of aesthetics (composite filling, prosthesis).

 Extraction is treatment of choice for significantly traumatized primary/deciduous teeth with
    mobility and or displacement. Judge the time which the tooth had to remain before
    expected exfoliation.

Refer to a dentist, where available orthodontics or endodontic specialist depending on the need
of advanced treatment

Note: Referral to oral and maxillofacial surgeon is done to patients with complicated
maxillofacial injuries.

Prevention
Proper design of playing grounds, observe road traffic rules, early orthodontic treatment

                                CHAPTER THREE

           GASTRO INTESTINAL DISEASE CONDITION

1.0 INFECTIONS OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

1.1 Amebiasis

Amebiasis is an infection caused by the protozoa organism E histolytica, which can cause colitis
and other extra intestinal manifestations, including liver abscess (most common) and
pleuropulmonary, cardiac, and cerebral dissemination. This can be through hematogenous
spread as septic emboli from the gut wall or sub diaphragmatic abscess rapture into the pleural
space or pericardium.

E histolytica is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route. Infective cysts can be found in
fecally contaminated food and water supplies and contaminated hands of food handlers. Sexual
transmission is possible, especially in the setting of oral-anal practices.

Diagnosis of Amebic colitis
     Gradual onset of bloody diarrhea
     Abdominal pain
     Fever
     Spanning several weeks' duration
     Rectal bleeding without diarrhea can occur, especially in children
     Fulminant or necrotizing colitis usually manifests as severe bloody diarrhea and diffuse
         abdominal pain with evidence of peritonitis and fever.

     However when symptoms occur, they include acute and/or chronic diarrhea, without
         blood or pus.In few cases malabsorption syndrome may occur
     Extra intestinal manifestations are rare and include allergic manifestations such as
         urticaria, erythema multiform, bronchospasm, reactive arthritis, and biliary tract disease

Investigation: Microscopic stool examination of Giardia intestinalis trophozoites or cysts of
infected patient, sensitivity increases on serial 3 samples examination.

1.3 Ascariasis

It is an intestinal infection caused by Ascaris lumbricoides; predominates in areas of poor
sanitation and is associated with malnutrition, iron-deficiency anemia, and impairments of
growth and cognition.

Diagnosis
     Most patients are asymptomatic
     When symptoms occur, they are divided into 2 categories: early (larval migration) and
         late (mechanical effects)

     In the early phase (4-16 days after egg ingestion): Fever, Nonproductive cough,
         Dyspnea, Wheezing.

     In the late phase (6-8 weeks after egg ingestion): Passage of worms (from mouth,
         nares, anus); diffuse or epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; pharyngeal globus,
         "tingling throat" frequent throat clearing, dry cough; complications - biliary and intestinal
         obstruction, appendicitis, pancreatitis and malnutrition.

Treatment
Drug of choice

                   A: Mebendazole (PO): Adult and Children above 2 years 100mg 12 hourly for 3
                   days OR 500mg as a single dose

duodenale or Necator americanus. It is one of the main causes of anaemia in the tropics which
is also the major clinical feature.

Diagnosis
     The majority of patients are asymptomatic

38 | P a g e
     The major clinical manifestations are iron deficiency anemia and hypoalbuminaemia.
Treatment
Drug of choice

                   A: Mebendazole: Adult and Children over 2 years 100mg (O) 12 hourly for 3 days

         Note:
         · Both Albendazole and Mebendazole must be chewed. If ova persist, give second
         course after 3 ­ 4 weeks.
         · Iron replacement and nutritional supplementation (protein and vitamins) should be
         part of the management strategy.
         CAUTION
         Albendazole is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy and children below 2
         years

39 | P a g e
1.5 Strongyloidiasis

Intestinal infection caused by two species of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides. The most
common and clinically important pathogenic species in humans is S stercoralis. Distinctive
characteristic of this parasite is its ability to persist and replicate within a host for decades while
producing minimal or no symptoms in individuals with an intact immune system and its
potential to cause life-threatening infection (hyperinfection syndrome, disseminated
strongyloidiasis) in an immunocompromised host associated with high mortality rates.

Diagnosis
     The symptoms related to strongyloidiasis may reflect the nematode's systemic passage,
         its local cutaneous involvement or both.
     During chronic uncomplicated infections, the larvae may migrate to the skin, where they
         can cause cutaneous strongyloidiasis, known as larva currens because of the quick
         migratory rate of the larva.
     The intestinal infection is usually asymptomatic but patients may have vague symptoms
         such as abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, vomiting, diarrhea and even epigastric pain.
     In malnourished children, strongyloidiasis remains an important cause of chronic
         diarrhea, cachexia, and failure to thrive.
     Strongyloidiasis can lead to gastrointestinal (GI), pulmonary, dermatologic, neurologic,
         gram negative bacteremia and other complications especially in patients with
         hyperinfection.

Treatment
Drug of choice

                   C: Ivermectin (O): Adults and children over 5 years; 200mcg/kg daily for 2days
                   and Up to 7-10 days for disseminated infection

                   C: Thiabendazole (O): Adults: 25mg/kg body weight (max.1.5g) 12 hourly for 3
                   days. Children give the same dose same as for adults
Note: Tablets must be chewed

Alternatively
                   A: Albendazole: Adults 400mg (O) 12 hourly for 3 days, the medicines may be
                   repeated after 3weeks. For disseminated infection give 7-10 days.
                     Children over 2 years give 15mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days (7-10
                   days for disseminated infection)

Note:
     Provide antibiotic therapy directed toward enteric pathogens if bacteremia or meningitis
         is present or suspected
     Provide supportive treatment as indicated (eg, intravenous fluids if volume depletion,
         blood transfusion if gastrointestinal or alveolar hemorrhage, mechanical ventilation if
         respiratory failure)
     Symptomatic treatment should be initiated

40 | P a g e
     Pruritic dermatologic manifestations should be treated with antihistamines
     Inhaled beta-agonists may improve wheezing

1.6 Cestodiasis

Tapeworms disease is acquired from eating raw or undercooked beef infected with cysticercus
bovis, the larval stage of Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) or undercooked food containing
Cystercercus cellulosae, the larval stage of Taenia solium (pork tapeworm). Less commonly
cestode includes Diphyllobohrium latum (poorly cooked fish) and Hymenolepsis nana (fecal oral
contamination by both human and animals especially dogs).

Diagnosis
     Most tape worm infections are symptomless
     The commonest way of presentation is the appearance of proglottides or segments in
         the stool
     There may be mild epigastric discomfort, nausea, weight loss and diarrhea
     More specific features depend on the type of the parasite

Laboratory Diagnosis:
Macro and Microscopic stool examination for ova and parasites. It is indicated for some of the
cestodes that release eggs or worm segments directly into the stool. Collecting 2-3 stool
samples increases the sensitivity. Ultrasonography, CT, MRI, Stool antigen, ELISA tests are
valuable in detecting and confirming other forms (i.e. Cystercercosis, Echinococcosis).

Treatment
For Taenia solium, Taenia saginata and Diphyllobothrium latum
Drug of choice
Adults and children over 6 years:

                   C: Niclosamide 2g (PO) as a single dose after a light breakfast, followed by a
         purgative (e.g. Magnesium sulphate) after 2 hours.

aspiration, injection, and re-aspiration).

                   A: Albendazole 400mg every 12 hours is recommended for 1-3 months before
         surgical intervention.

Note:
     Administer parenteral vitamin B-12 if evidence of vitamin B-12 deficiency occurs with
         Diphyllobothrium infections
     Tablets should be chewed thoroughly before washing down with water.

CAUTION: Avoid Niclosamide during the first trimester of pregnancy.

1.7 Typhoid and paratyphoid

It is an acute systemic disease resulting form infection by Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi,
serovar group A and B respectively. Infection is acquired through ingestion of contaminated
food and water.
Diagnosis

     The clinical manifestation and duration of illness vary markedly from one patient to
         another

42 | P a g e
     The major clinical features are fever, severe headache, drowsiness and muscle pains
         (myalgia)

     The course of paratyphoid tend be to shorter and less severe compared to typhoid
     Untreated, typhoid fever is a grueling illness that may progress to delirium, obtundation,

         intestinal hemorrhage, bowel perforation, and death
     Survivors may be left with long-term or permanent neuropsychiatric complications.

Laboratory diagnosis:
The diagnosis of typhoid fever (enteric fever) is primarily clinical. Culture is the criterion
standard for diagnosis of typhoid fever with 100% specificity. Culture of bone marrow aspirate;
blood and stool cultures should be done within 1 week of onset. Supportive serologic tests:
Widal test (rising high titers), indirect fluorescent Vi antibody, ELISA for immunoglobulin M
(IgM) and IgG antibodies to S typhi polysaccharide.

Treatment
Drug of choice

                   A: Ciprofloxacin (O): Adult and children over 15 years 500mg 12 hourly for 10
                   days

Alternatively

                   A: Chloramphenicol (PO): Adult 500mg 6 hourly for 14 days

                   Children above 1 years 12.5mg/kg/dose, 6 hourly for 14 days.

CAUTION
Ciprofloxacin is contraindicated in children below 15 years and pregnant women.
Chloramphenicol is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy; it may also cause
aplastic anaemia which is irreversible.

1.8 Schistosomiasis

Parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (trematodes) of the genus Schistosoma. Common
species found in Tanzania are S. haematobium responsible for urogenital Schistosomiasis and S.
mansoni responsible for intestinal Schistosomiasis. Infection is through the larval forms of the
parasite which is released by freshwater snails. The parasite then, penetrates the skin during
contact with infested water. In the body, the larvae develop into adult schistosomes. Adult
worms live in the blood vessels, where the females release eggs. Some of the eggs are passed
out of the body in the feces or urine to continue the parasite life-cycle. Others become trapped
in body tissues, causing an immune reaction and progressive damage to organs.

Diagnosis
Schistosoma mansoni

     There may be abdominal pain and frequent blood stained stool

43 | P a g e
     In chronic form of Schistosoma mansoni; abdominal distention, and vomiting of blood
         and liver fibrosis (Portal hypertension)

     People co-infected with either hepatitis B or C and S mansoni have been shown to have
         rapid progression of liver disease.

Schistosoma hematobium
     The main clinical feature is painless terminal hematuria
     In chronic and complicated situations can lead to renal failure due to obstructive
         uropathy, pyelonephritis, or bladder carcinoma (10-20 years after the initial infection)
     In addition, immune complexes that contain worm antigens may deposit in the
         glomeruli, leading to glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis.

Laboratory diagnosis
Perform stool or urine analysis to identify and specify the eggs in the stool or urine. Kato Katz
thick fecal smear technique is needed for chronic disease stage of the iintestine and liver.
Diagnostic yields are improved by repeated stool samples and from biopsies at sigmoidoscopy.
Schistosomal ELISA confirms exposure and if negative reliably excludes infection.

Treatment
Drug of choice

                   C: Praziquantel: 40mg/kg (O) as a single dose or in 2 divided doses.

NOTE:
     High doses (20mg/kg) as single dose for 2 days for heavy S. Mansoni infections
     Medicines will usually arrest progression of clinical features, but will not reverse them
     Surgical interventions may be necessary.

1.9 Shigellosis

Shigella organisms are a group of gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria pathogens.
They are grouped into 4 species: Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, and
Shigella sonnei, also known as groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Shigellosis is spread by
means of fecal-oral, ingestion of contaminated food or water.

Diagnosis
     Sudden onset of severe abdominal cramping, high-grade fever, emesis, anorexia, and
         large-volume watery diarrhea; seizures may be an early manifestation.
     Abdominal pain, tenesmus, urgency, fecal incontinence, and small-volume mucoid
         diarrhea with frank blood (fractional stools) may subsequently occur.
     Extra intestinal manifestations associated with S dysenteriae may include the following:
         Severe headache, lethargy, meningismus, delirium, and convulsions involving the CNS;
         hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
         thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, profound dehydration and hypoglycemia.

Laboratory diagnosis
Perform microscopic stool examination isolation of Shigella from feces or rectal swab specimen.

         contraindicated in epilepsy and renal failure.

1.10 Cholera

Cholera is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused by Vibrio cholera organisms (El Tor and
Classical biotypes). In Tanzania only the El Tor biotype occurs. Infection occurs through
ingestion of contaminated water or food by human feces.

Diagnosis
     After a 24 to 48 hours incubation period, cholera begins with the sudden onset of
         painless watery diarrhea that may quickly become severe with profuse watery stools
         (rice water), vomiting, severe dehydration and muscular cramps leading to hypovolemic
         shock and death
     The stool has a characteristic "rice water" appearance (non bilious, gray, slightly cloudy
         fluid with flecks of mucus, no blood and inoffensive odor)

Laboratory Diagnosis
Dark field microscopy on a wet mount of fresh stool for identification of motile curved bacillus.
Isolation through stool culture is best done through TCBS agar. Vibrio serotype can be
discerned by immobilization with specific antiserum.
.
Treatment

     Rehydration, electrolytes and base correction is the most important step
     Management of severely dehydrated patient, IV fluid replacement is preferable
     Oral rehydration is indicated in moderate forms of dehydration but is ineffective in the

         presence of significant vomiting

45 | P a g e
For Severe dehydration
     Administer intravenous (I.V) fluid immediately to replace fluid deficit; Use lactated
         Ringer solution or, if that is not available, isotonic sodium chloride solution.
     For patients older than 1 year, give 100 mls/kg I.V in 3 hours--30 mls/kg as rapidly as
         possible (within 30 min) then 70 mls/kg in the next 2 hours. For patients younger than 1
         year, administer 100 mls/kg IV in 6 hours--30 mls/kg in the first hour then 70 mls/kg in
         the next 5 hours. Monitor the patient frequently.
     After the initial 30 mls/kg has been administered, the radial pulse should be strong and
         blood pressure should be normal. If the pulse is not yet strong, continue to give I.V fluid
         rapidly. Administer ORS solution (about 5 mls/kg/h) as soon as the patient can drink, in
         addition to I.V fluid.
     If the patient can drink, begin giving oral rehydration salt solution (ORS) by mouth while
         the drip is being set up; ORS can provide the potassium, bicarbonate, and glucose that
         saline solution lacks.
     Reassess the hydration status after 3 hours (infants after 6 hrs), In the rare case that
         the patient still exhibits signs of severe dehydration, repeat the I.V therapy protocol. If
         signs of some dehydration are present, continue as indicated below for some
         dehydration. If no signs of dehydration exist, maintain hydration by replacing ongoing
         fluid losses.
     Start antibiotics (see regimen below) after the patient is rehydrated and vomiting has
         stopped usually after 4-6 hours. Although the disease is self limiting, an effective
         antibiotic will reduce the volume of diarrhea and shorten the period during which Vibrio
         cholera is excreted. Antibiotic prophylaxis may be given to all close contacts in the same
         dosage as for treatment.
     Start feeding 3-4 hours after oral rehydration begins. Preferably, give antibiotics with
         food to minimize vomiting.

In moderate Dehydration
     Give oral rehydration, approximately 75-100ml/kg in the first four hours
     Reassess after four hours; if improved, continue giving WHO based ORS, in quantity
         corresponding to losses (eg after each stool) or 10 to 20ml/kg. If not improved, treat as
         severe

If no signs of dehydration
     For patients who have no signs of dehydration when first observed can be treated at
         home
     Give these patients ORS packets to take home, enough for 2 days
     Demonstrate how to prepare and give the solution
     Instruct the patient or the caretaker to return if any of the following signs develop;
         increased number of watery stools repeated vomiting or any signs indicating other
         problems (eg, fever, blood in stool).

Drugs of choice

                   A: Doxycycline (O): Adult and child above 12 years; 300 mg as a single dose or
         5mg/kg single dose

46 | P a g e
                                                 OR

                   A:Erythromycin (O): Adult 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days

                   Children: 40mg/kg/day given in 3 divided doses for 5 days

                                                 OR

                   A: Ciprofloxacin (O): Adult: 30mg/kg single dose (not to exceed 1g) or 15mg/kg
         12 hourly for 3 days

NOTE
     A home made ORS equivalent is 6 teaspoons of sugar and one half teaspoon of salt in a
         liter of water; a half cup of orange juice or some mashed banana can provide
         potassium.
     Urine output decreases as dehydration develops and may cease. It usually resumes
         within 6-8 hours after starting rehydration. Regular urinary output (i.e., every 3-4 h) is a
         good sign that enough fluid is being given.
     In all suspected case notify Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) immediately.
         For confirmation at the beginning of an outbreak, take rectal swab or stool specimen,
         handle properly and transport carefully to laboratory.
     Treat on site without referral wherever possible.

  CAUTION: Doxycycline should not be used in pregnancy and children below 12 years

1.11 General management of diarrheal diseases

Diarrhea is defined as the abrupt onset of abnormally high fluid content in the stool: more than
the normal value of approximately 10 mls/kg/d in the infant and young child, and more than
200 g/d in the teenager and adult. This situation typically implies an increased frequency of
bowel movements, which can range from 4-5 to more than 20 times per day. The augmented
water content in the stools is due to an imbalance in the physiology of the small and large
intestinal processes involved in the absorption of ions, organic substrates, and thus water.

Childhood acute diarrhea is usually caused by infection; however, numerous disorders may
cause this condition, including a malabsorption syndrome and various enteropathies. Acute-
onset diarrhea is usually self-limited; however, an acute infection can have a protracted course.
By far, the most common complication of acute diarrhea is dehydration.

Diarrheal episodes are classically distinguished into acute and chronic (or persistent) based on
their duration. Acute diarrhea is thus defined as an episode that has an acute onset and lasts
no longer than 14 days; chronic or persistent diarrhea is defined as an episode that lasts longer
than 14 days. This distinction is supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).

It is most practical to base treatment of diarrhea on the clinical types of the illness, which can
easily be determined when a patient is first examined. Laboratory studies are very useful. Four

47 | P a g e
clinical types of diarrhea can be recognized, each reflecting the basic underlying pathology and
altered pathology:

     Acute Watery Diarrhoea (including Cholera): which lasts several hours or days. The main
         danger is dehydration and malnutrition if feeding is not continued

     Bloody Diarrhoea (Dysentery): the main dangers are damage of intestinal mucosa,
         sepsis, and malnutrition. Other complications including dehydration may also occur

     Persistent (Chronic) Diarrhoea: Last for 14 days or longer, the main danger is
         malnutrition and serious non-intestinal infections, dehydration may also occur

     Dirrhoea with Severe Malnutrition (Marasmus or Kwashiorkor): the main dangers are
         severe systemic infection, dehydration, heart failure, vitamin and mineral deficiency.

Note: The basis for the management of each type of dirrhoea is to prevent or treat dangers
that present.

              I. Management of diarrhea in children
     Over 90% of deaths from diarrhea in under-fives would be prevented by:
     Continuing breast feeding and other feeding throughout the attack of diarrhea (prevent

         malnutrition)
     Making sure mothers know when to take the child to a health facility
     Correct assessment, treatment and continued feeding at the health facility level (See

         IMCI from the MoHSW manual)
     Treatment of invasive diarrhea (bloody stool) with antibiotics
     Treating or preventing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance with ORS (New osmolarity

         ORS)
     Reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea and occurrence of future episodes by

         giving supplemental Zinc
     Referring to hospital for investigation and treatment for severe malnutrition and

         persistent diarrhea (lasting>14 days)

Other signs which may be useful in assessing severe dehydration and influence management
include:

     Weight loss over a short period
     Signs of hypovolemic shock: fast weak pulses, cold extremities, oliguria or anuria
     Hyperventilation, deep and fast breathing indicating acidosis
     Signs of severe malnutrition

              II. Management of diarrhea in adults
The principles of management of diarrhea in adult are the same as in children in correction of
fluid deficit. As much as possible the cause for diarrhea in adult should be established. Special
care should be taken for patients who are immunodeficient e.g. in cases of HIV/AIDS; and/or
those with associated chronic disease condition including malignancy. However, the most
common cause for diarrhea in adult is food poisoning which is normally self-limiting.

Management of Chronic Diarrhea in Adults.
This may account to 5% but may be under estimation as many patients don't seek medical
attention. Causes may include: Medications, mal absorption syndrome, colitides, GI and neuro
endocrine tumours, endocroniopathies, chronic infections, and dysmotility bowel syndrome.

48 | P a g e
Clinical evaluation therefore needs detailed history and examination to determine the
pathophysiologic mechanism of diarrhea which will help to stratify the modality of diagnostic
evaluation.
Diagnostic evaluation involves;
-Detailed stool analysis: PH, osmolarity, electrolytes, infectious etiologies including clostridium
deficile toxin assay, fecal occult blood, fecal fat assay, fecal leucocytes or lactoferin, fecal alpha
antitrypsin or elastase, fecal chymotrypsin and laxative screen.
- Full hemogram and ESR.
-Comprehensive metabolic panel: liver functions, renal functions, thyroid functions;
- Urine studies for protenuria and laxative screen, urinary metanephrines and histamines.
- Hormonal assays: serum levels of VIP, gastrin, calcitonin, pancreatic polypeptide,
somatostatin, tryptase.
- Serum protein immunoglobulins electrophoresis.
Treatment Guide:
- Correct volume status, electrolyte disturbances and vitamin deficiencies.
- Treat specific underlying cause(s)
- For mild to moderate diarrhea use Loperamide 2- 4mg 6hrly (O) or Diphenoxylate with
Atropine 4mg 6hrly.
- In established secretory diarrhea, Octreotide 50 ­ 250 mcg 12 hrly (SC) is indicated to
decrease the volume of stool.
­ Empiric treatment with Metronidazole 400mg 8hrly(O) or Ciprofloxacin 500 12 hrly(O) for 5 -
7 days can be considered if patient is at high risk of dehydration, development of systemic
complication, or high prevalence of infectious diarrhea in the community.
­ Surgical treatment is indicated in established conditions such as, neuro endocrine tumor
(NET), severe colitis, or malignancy.

2.0 DISORDERS OF GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT

2.1 Peptic Ulcer Disease

The term peptic ulceration refers to an ulcer in the lower esophagus; stomach and duodenum.
They have in common the involvement of acid-pepsin in their pathogenesis leading to disruption
of the mucosal integrity causing local defect or excavation due to active inflammation. The
common ulcers are duodenal and/or gastric.

Peptic ulcer may present in many different ways, the commonest is chronic, episodic pain
present in many different ways, and may persist for months or years. However, the ulcer may
come to attention as an acute episode with bleeding or perforation, with little or no previous
history. As with duodenal ulcer, epigastric pain is the commonest symptom of gastric ulcer.

2.1.1 Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease. (GERD)
It is a disorder resulting from gastric acid and other gastric contents into the esophagus due to
incompetent barriers at the gastro esophageal junction.

Diagnosis
     Heartburn and regurgitation of sour material into the mouth are specific symptoms
     Symptoms for persistent disease may include odynophagia, dysphagia, weight loss and
         bleeding
     Extra esophageal manifestation are due to reflux of gastric contents into the pharynx,
         larynx, trachealbrochial tree, nose and mouth causing chronic cough, laryngitis,
         pharyngitis. It may also cause or aggravate chronic bronchitis, asthma, COPD,
         pneumonia, chronic sinusitis and dental decay.

Investigation
Diagnosis clinically by history alone and therapeutic trial of H2 receptor blocker or proton pump
inhibitors (PPI) such as cimetidine 400mg 12hourly or Omeprazole 40mg 12 hourly respectively
for 1 week, provides support for diagnosis of GERD. Esophagoscopy is valuable but not
diagnostic for GERD, double contrast Barium meal is acceptable alternative to patient unwilling
to undergo endoscopy. The 24-hours esophageal PH Metry is the specific procedure to confirm
presence of GERD.

Treatment
The goals of treatment are to provide symptom relief, heal erosive esophagitis and prevent
complication. Life style changes and antisecretory agents may be adequate.

Drug of choice is H2 Receptor blockers which are effective in symptoms relief and are
considered as first line

                   C: Ranitidine 150mg (O) 12 hourly for 14 days;
                   Children 2 -4mg/kg 12 hourly for 14 days.

Proton Pump inhibitors (PPI) are considered as second line and are much more effective in
healing ulcers or erosive esophagitis.

50 | P a g e
Drug of Choice

                   C:Omeprazole 20mg (O) once daily for 4 -8 weeks

                   Children 10 -20kg body weight 10mg once daily for 4-8 weeks.

Alternatively

                   D: Esomeprazole 40mg (O) once daily for 4-8 weeks, then 20mg once daily for
         maintenance to prevent relapse.

Referral
Refer to specialized centers for all cases with persistent symptoms and/or new complications
despite appropriate treatment above.
NOTE
Specific lifestyle changes for patient advice may include

     Reduce spices, and avoid foods and fruits that exacerbate pain in individual patients
     Stop smoking and avoid alcohol
     Low consumption of coffee or tea
     Avoid carbonated drinks
     Avoid medicines such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) aspirin,

         steroids.

2.1.2 Gastro duodenal Ulcers (PUD)
General Management

     Consider peptic ulcer general measures as above
     Referral to a specialist is recommended in presence of persistent symptoms or new

         onset complications
     Endoscopic biopsy to exclude malignancy in all refractory cases is mandatory
     Evaluation and treatment of H. Pylori associated infection is mandatory for effective

         treatment.

Management of Helicobacter pylori infection
Gastric infection with the bacterium H.Pylori accounts for majority of PUD. It also plays role in
development of gastric mucosal ­ associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) Lymphoma and Gastric
adenocarcinoma.

Laboratory diagnosis
     Perform stool antigen testing; the test should be repeated 3 months after therapy to
         confirm eradication
     Perform urea breath tests; the test require the patient to be off PPI therapy for 14 days
         and same days after eradication therapy

51 | P a g e
     Perform biopsy for urease test; more specific, helpful in cases where antibiotic sensitivity
         testing is required

     Serology confirms the exposure but not necessarily an active infection

Treatment
Triple therapy is indicated for complete eradication of the organism.
Omeprazole (PO) 20mg twice daily + Amoxicillin (PO)1g twice daily + Metronidazole (PO)
400mg twice daily for 7 days

                             OR
Lansoprazole (PO) 30mg twice daily + Clarithromycin (PO) 250mg twice + Tinidazole (PO)
500mg twice daily for 7 days.

2.2 Ulcer Related Conditions

2.2.1 Non-ulcer Dyspepsia (Functional Dyspepsia)
Defined as  3 months discomforting postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric
pain/burning in the absence of organic cause. Most patient follow a benign course, but small
number of patients with H.Pylori infection or those on NSAIDs progress to ulcer formation. It is
the cause of symptoms in more than 60% of patients with dyspepsia.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis clinically as above, plus endoscopic exclusion of esophagitis, peptic ulceration, or
malignancy

Treatment
     Eradicate H.Pylori if present, if symptoms continue or recurs use H2RB or PPI on per
         demand basis to control symptoms.
     Use of Prokinetic agents such as Domperidone or Metoclopramide in short course of 2 to
         8 weeks, shows beneficial effect at reducing dyspeptic symptoms.
                   D:Domperidone (PO): Adults: 10 -20 mg 6-8 hourly daily taken 30minutes before
         meals; Children: (5- 12 Years) 5 -10mg 6-8 hourly
                                       OR
                   C:Metoclopramide (PO): Adults: 10mg 8hourly daily
                             Children: 0.5mg/kg/day in 3devided doses daily
         Counseling and reassurance are important.

2.2.2 Gastritis
Acute gastritis is a term covering a broad spectrum of entities that induce inflammatory changes
in the gastric mucosa. The different etiologies share the same general clinical presentation.
However, they differ in their unique histological characteristics. The inflammation may involve
the entire stomach (e.g., pan gastritis) or a region of the stomach (e.g., antral gastritis). Acute
gastritis can be broken down into 2 categories: erosive (e.g., superficial erosions, deep
erosions, hemorrhagic erosions) and non erosive (generally caused by Helicobacter pylori).

52 | P a g e
Common etiologies includes certain drugs, alcohol, bacterial, viral, and fungal infections; acute
stress, radiation, allergy and food poisoning, bile, ischemia, and direct trauma.

Diagnosis
     Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, belching, and bloating
     Occasionally, acute abdominal pain can be a presenting symptom
     Fever, chills, and hiccups also may be present

Note
     The diagnosis of acute gastritis may be suspected from the patient's history and can be
         confirmed histologically by biopsy specimens taken at endoscopy
     A number of laboratory tests may also be ordered depending on suspected etiology
         which may include Full hemogram, Liver and Renal functions test

Treatment
     Administer medical therapy as needed, depending on the cause and the pathological
         findings
     No specific therapy exists for acute gastritis, except for cases caused by H pylori
     Administer fluids and electrolytes as required, particularly if the patient is vomiting
     Discontinue the use of drugs known to cause gastritis (e.g., NSAIDs, alcohol)
     Consider short course use of Antacids, H2RB or PPI for relief of symptoms

2.3 Management of GI Bleeding

Acute gastro intestinal (GI) bleeding is common medical emergency resulting in significant
morbidity and mortality. It can occur anywhere from mouth to anus; it is therefore subdivided
into upper gastrointestinal bleeding(UGIB), anatomically above the ligament of Treitz; and lower
gastrointestinal bleeding(LGIB), which is further subdivided to small bowel bleeding(middle GIB)
and Colonic bleeding.

Causes for UGIB include, erosive ulcerative disease, esophagitis, portal varices and gastropathy,
vascular ectasias, Mallory weiss tear and tumours. Causes for LGIB include, Diverticular disease,
hemorrhoids, anal fissures, infectious and radiation colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, polyps,
tumours, vascular ectasias and intussusceptions especially in children.

Diagnostic guide

Begin with an assessment of patient's hemodynamic status (normal, orthostatic hypotension, or
shock), while trying to localize the acute GIB through focused history and examination. Include
the following in history, description of bleeding, duration and frequency, prior bleeding,
cormobidities, medications, previous surgery, recent polypectomy or prior radiation.

53 | P a g e
Assess for the vital signs, stigmata of liver disease, abdominal tenderness, stool colour by rectal
examination, nasogatric aspiration may show a positive gastric aspirate.

Diagnostic procedures:

Do baseline investigation, Full hemogram, Coagulopathy profile, liver and renal functions.
Specifically, upper and lower endoscopy is appropriately indicated. While Tagged red cell scan
and Angiography would be indicated for rapidly or obscure bleeding patients.

Treatment guide

1. Pharmacological

-  Intravascular volume replacement should be restored with either ringers lactate or

   isotonic saline through large bore IV lines.

-  Blood transfusion with packed red blood cells should immediately follow. Correct severe

   thrombocytopenia with packed platelet concentrates, while overt coagulopathy should

   be corrected with fresh frozen plasma, and Vitamin K S.C injection 5 -10 mg stat given

   to stable patients.

-  Institute (IV) proton pump inhibitors e.g. Esomeprazole 40mg 12hrly. For 3-5 days, then

   oral therapy up to 6 weeks.

-  Add Octreotide 50mcg (IV) stat then 50mcg 8hrly (IV) for 3-5 days specifically for

   varecial bleeding

-  Add ciprofloxacin 400mg 12hrly (IV), or Metronidazole 500 8hrly (IV), or Ceftriaxone

   1gm 12hrly (IV) for 3-7 days especially in varecial bleeding.

2. Non Pharmacological

-  Endoscopy done within 24 hours could confirm diagnosis and provide sustained

   hemostasis control. Therapeutic modalities include variceal band ligation, Hemocliping,

   sclerotherapy, injectional tamponade therapy, thermocoagulation and angiographic

   embolization.

3. Surgical Management

-  TIPS or shunt therapy is indicated in patients with esophageal varices who have failed

   pharmacologic and endoscopy therapy or those with bleeding gastric fundic varices.

-  Surgical laparatomy for small bowel resection or colectomy is indicated as salvage

   therapy for small group of patients whom pharmacological, endescopic, and

   angiotherapy have failed.

Note: Refer stabilized patients with GIB to specialized centres for expertise management.

54 | P a g e
Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease, probably involving an immune
reaction of the body to its own intestinal tract. The 2 major types of IBD are ulcerative colitis
(UC) and Crohn disease (CD). As the name suggests, ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon.
Crohn disease can involve any segment of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus

2.4.1 Ulcerative colitis

Inflammatory condition that affects the rectum extends proximally to affect a variable amount
of the colon. Smoking appears to worsen the disease condition.

Diagnosis

     Active disease is associated with diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus,
         and crampy abdominal pain

     Severity of symptoms correlates with the extent of disease

     Occasionally, diarrhea and bleeding is intermittent and mild that the patient may not
         seek medical attention, thus though UC can present acutely, symptoms usually have
         been present for weeks to month

     Complication may present as, Massive hemorrhage (<1%); Toxic megacolon,
         Perforation with features of peritonitis, stricture.

Note

Diagnosis relies upon the patient's history; clinical symptoms; negative stool examination for
bacteria, C.difficile toxin, ova and parasites; sigmoidoscopic appearance; and histology of rectal
or colonic biopsy specimen. Single contrast barium enema alternative to sigmoidoscopy but is
limited by biopsy access. Supportive laboratory test: CBC for anemia; Thrombocytosis,
leucocytosis may reflect active disease.

Treatment and Referral                                                             expertise
     Refer patients to specialized centers once disease is suspected for
         management

     Cure is not available, goals of therapy are to induce and maintain remission

      Drug of Choice

               C: Sulphasalazine (PO): Adults, 1 gram four times a day for acute disease,
               reducing to 500mg four times a day for maintenance; Children over 2 years for
               acute attack use 40-60mg/kg body weight daily.

               Maintenance dose 20-30mg/kg body weight daily.

              Plus

              B: Prednisolone (PO) 30-60mg once daily for severe, acute and extensive
              disease; reduces gradually according to disease severity.

Note

55 | P a g e
     Correction of fluid deficit and/or blood is important in acute severe forms which may
         necessitates hospitalization

     Nutritional therapy should target to replenish specific nutrient deficits
     Life long surveillance is required due to risk of bowel cancer
     Use steroids only when the disease is confirmed, to avoid exacerbation of existing

         illness.

2.4.2 Crohn's Disease
Crohn's disease is an idiopathic, chronic, transmural inflammatory process of the bowel that
often leads to fibrosis and obstructive symptoms and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal
tract from the mouth to the anus.

Diagnosis
     Mainly abdominal pain and diarrhea; weight loss, anorexia, and fever may be seen
     Growth retardation in children
     Gross rectal bleeding or acute hemorrhage is uncommon
     Anemia is a common complication due to illeal disease involvement
     Small bowel obstruction, due to stricturing
     Perianal disease associated with fistulization
     Gastroduodenal involvement may be mistaken for H.Pylori negative PUD

Diagnostic consideration
     Endoscopy gold standard for diagnosing colonic and terminal illeal disease and readily
         permits mucosal biopsy and balloon dilatation of any stricture
     Barium follow through is still standard method for evaluating the small bowel, though
         capsule enterescopy is superior
     Discriminating features that favours Crohn's from Ulcerative colitis include small bowel
         disease, mainly right sided colonic disease, rectal sparing, fistulization, and granulomas.
         Immunological makers: pANCA is predictive in 70% of UC but only15% in CD;
         Antibodies to Saccharomyces cervisiae are found in up to 50% CD and less often in UC.
         When done together specificity is further improved
     Supportive laboratory tests: CBC for anemia; thrombocytosis, leucocytosis, as serrogate
         sign of inflammation, iron and folate studies, liver functions test,
         electrolytes/micronutrient deficiency assessment (calcium, magnesium, zinc).

Treatment
     Refer suspected cases to specialized centers for expertise management
     Baseline management as for Ulcerative Colitis above

2.4.3 Pseudomembrenous colitis
Clostridium difficile is organism responsible for an infectious colitis that affects 1 of every 200
patients who are admitted to the hospital. Increasingly implicated as a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, C difficile colitis should also be recognized

56 | P a g e
among outpatient populations. Prior antibiotic exposure remains the most significant risk factor
for development of disease. Antibiotics first seen with clindamycin, but amoxylin and the
cephalosporin's are now most frequently implicated. Extreme age, recent GI surgery,
malignancy, prolonged hospital stay are other risk factors.

Diagnosis
     Diarrhea and abdominal cramps occurs during first week, but can be delayed up to six
         weeks
     Nausea, fever, dehydration can accompany severe colitis
     Abdominal examination may reveal distension and tenderness.

Note
     Stool examination is sensitive on anaerobic culture facilities which reveals toxigenic and
         non toxigenic strains
     Enzyme immunoassays are available for toxins A and B in stool
     Sigmoidoscopy is highly specific if lesion is seen but insensitive compared to the above.

Treatment
Drug of choice

                   A: Metronidazole (PO): Adults, 400mg 8hourly for 5-days
Children 1 month-12 years: 7.5 mg/kg (max. 400mg) every 8 hours
Second line

                   D:Vancomycin (PO/IV): Adults, 125mg ­ 500mg 6hourly for 5- 10days
                 Children > 1month : 40mg/kg/day in devided doses.

2.5 Irritable Bowel syndrome

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional GI disorder characterized by abdominal pain and
altered bowel habits in the absence of specific and unique organic pathology.

Diagnosis
     Abdominal discomfort of at least 3 months duration
     Bloating or feeling of distension
     Altered bowel habits (constipation and/or diarrhea)
     Exacerbations triggered by life events.
     Coexistance of anxiety and depression.

Diagnostic Considerations
     Hematology and biochemistry studies
     Stool microscopy
     Colonoscopy with biopsy

57 | P a g e
Treatment
     Refer patients to specialized centers for proper evaluation and management.
     Supportive therapies;
     Reassurance and explanation are essential.
     High fibre diet and eating a healthy diet.
     Relief of pain due to abdominal cramps

                         A: Hyoscine butyl bromide 20mg (O) four times a day
     Relief of anxiety that may be making symptoms worse

                        C: Diazepam 5-10 mg (O) 8 hourly
         Give short and infrequent courses only, in order to avoid dependance.
     If constipation is predominant in IBS encourage high fiber diet.
     If diarrhea predominant in IBS

                        C: Loperamide 4mg (O) stat, followed by 2mg after each unformed stool until
                   diarrhoea is controlled.
     Explore psycho-social factors in resistant cases and counseling.

2.6 Malabsorption syndrome

Malabsorption is a clinical term that encompasses defects occurring during the digestion and
absorption of food nutrients by and infections of the gastrointestinal tract. Although presenting
symptoms, such as diarrhea and weight loss may be common, the specific causes of
malabsorption are usually established based on physiologic evaluations. The treatment often
depends on the establishment of a definitive etiology for malabsorption. Etiologic examples
include pancreatic insufficiency, bacterial overgrowth, celiac disease, tropical sprue, lactase
deficiency, diabetic enteropathy, thyroid disease, radiation enteritis, gastrectomy and extensive
small bowel resection.

Diagnosis
Depending on etiology, presentation may collectively include:

     Diarrhoea a commonest symptom which is frequently watery
     Steatorrhea due to fat malabsorption; characterized, by the passage of pale, bulky, and

         malodorous stools. Stools often float on top of the toilet water and are difficult to flush
     Weight loss and fatigue
     Flatulence and abdominal distention
     Edema due to hypoalbuminemia, and with severe protein depletion ascites may develop
     Anemias which can either be microcytic iron deficiency (celiac disease) or macrocytic

         vitamin B-12 deficiency (chrohn's disease or illeal resection).
     Bleeding disorders (Ecchymosis, melena, and hematuria) due to vitamin K malabsorption

         and subsequent hypoprothrombinemia.
     Metabolic defects of bones (osteopenia or osteomalacia) due to vitamin D deficiency.

         Bone pain and pathologic fractures may be observed. Malabsorption of calcium can lead
         to secondary hyperparathyroidism.

58 | P a g e
     Neurologic manifestations: Electrolyte disturbances, such as hypocalcaemia and
         hypomagnesaemia, can lead to tetany. Vitamin malabsorption can cause generalized
         motor weakness (pantothenic acid, vitamin D) or peripheral neuropathy (thiamine), a
         sense of loss for vibration and position (cobalamin), night blindness (vitamin A), and
         seizures (biotin).

Treatment
     Patients should be referred to specialized centers for proper evaluation and definitive
         management
     Two basic principles underlie the management of patients with malabsorption, as
         follows:
              o The correction of nutritional deficiencies

              o When possible, the treatment of causative diseases

     Nutritional support
              o Supplementing various minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and
                   vitamins, which may be deficient in malabsorption, is important
              o Caloric and protein replacement also is essential
              o Medium-chain triglycerides can be used as fat substitutes because they do not
                   require micelle formation for absorption and their route of transport is portal
                   rather than lymphatic
              o In severe intestinal disease, such as massive resection and extensive regional
                   enteritis, parenteral nutrition may become necessary.

     Treatment of causative diseases
              o A gluten-free diet helps treat celiac disease
              o A lactose-free diet helps correct lactose intolerance; supplementing the first bite
                   of milk-containing food products with Lactaid also helps
              o Protease and lipase supplements are the therapy for pancreatic insufficiency
              o Antibiotics are the therapy for bacterial overgrowth
              o Corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory agents, such as mesalamine, and other
                   therapies are used to treat regional enteritis.

2.7 Pancreatitis

Pancreatitis is an inflammatory process in which pancreatic enzymes auto digest the gland. It
may present as acute pancreatitis, in which the pancreas can sometimes heal without any
impairment of function or any morphologic changes, or as chronic pancreatitis, in which
individuals suffer recurrent, intermittent attacks that contribute to the functional and
morphologic loss of the gland.

2.7.1 Acute Pancreatitis
It is due to sudden inflammation of the pancreas due to pancreatic enzymes auto digestion.
Common risk factors which trigger the acute episode are presence of gallstones and alcohol
intake.

Diagnosis
 Severe, unremitting epigastric pain, radiating to the back
 Nausea and vomiting

59 | P a g e
 Signs of shock may be present
 Ileus is also common
 Local complications: inflammatory mass, obstructive jaundice, gastric outlet obstruction
 Systemic complication: sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure

Diagnostic considerations
     Serum amylase, in counts over 1000U/L, but poor correlates with disease severity.
         Serum Lipase twice the normal limit has superior sensitivity and specificity.
     Complete blood counts, Urea and electrolytes, bicarbonate levels, liver transaminases
         and albumin, LDH, glucose, calcium, CRP, and lipid profile for modified Glasgow criteria
         to disease severity and outcomes.
     Abdominal ultrasound, Plain abdominal X-ray, Chest X-ray, CT Abdomen.

Treatment
     Prompt referral to specialized centers with intensive care facilities is recommended
     Principles of management include expertise supportive therapy:
              o Nil per oral regimen for few days up to weeks is indicated depending on severity.
          o Intravascular volume expansion (colloids/crystalloid)
          o Opiates analgesia and antiemetics usually required.
          o Prophylactic antibiotics in severe state, useful when there is evidence of sepsis(IV)
               ceftriaxone 1g 12hrly + Metronidazole 500mg 8hrly or Meronem 1g 8hrly
          o ERCP + Sphincterotomy when gallstones are present in the CBD.

2.7.2 Chronic Pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis is long-term (chronic) inflammation of the pancreas that leads to
permanent damage. The most common cause for such a condition is long-term excessive
alcohol consumption.

Diagnosis
     The most common symptom is upper abdominal pain that may be accompanied by
         nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite
     As the disease gets worse and more of the pancreas is destroyed, pain may actually
         become less severe
     During an attack, the pain often is made worse by drinking alcohol or eating a large
         meal high in fats.
     Because a damaged pancreas can't produce important digestive enzymes, people with
         chronic pancreatitis may develop problems with digesting and absorbing food and
         nutrients. This can lead to weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, diarrhea and greasy, foul-
         smelling stools.
     Over time, a damaged pancreas also can fail to produce enough insulin, which results in
         Diabetes.

Diagnostic Consideration:
 Abdominal X-ray, for evidence of pancreatic calcifications
 CT, MRCP, ERCP, and Endoscopic ultrasound are complementary
 Biochemical; Glucose tolerance test, serum vitamins (ADEK), hemoglobin and calcium levels,
Pancreatic function tests: Secretin /CCK ­ secretory test, fecal elastese1 concentrations

60 | P a g e
Treatment
Referral is recommended for expertise evaluation and management in specialized centers.
Because chronic pancreatitis cannot be cured, direct the treatment towards:

     Relieving pain with pain-killers- In rare cases, surgery/ ERCP to open blocked ducts
         or remove part of the pancreas may be done to relieve pain.

     Improving food absorption - The patient should be recommended to follow
         a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet that also restricts some types of fats. Once
         digestive problems are treated, patient will usually gain back weight and diarrhea
         improves. Another way is by giving the patient pancreatic supplements containing
         digestive enzymes.

     Treating diabetes - Treat diabetes with careful attention to diet to help keep blood
         sugar levels stable. In some people, insulin injections and other diabetic medications are
         needed.

2.8 Peritonitis

Refers to inflammation of the peritoneum; it may be localized or diffuse in location, acute or
chronic in natural history, infectious or aseptic in pathogenesis. Acute peritonitis is most often
infectious usually related to a perforated viscus (secondary peritonitis); primary or spontaneous
peritonitis refers to when no intraabdominal source is identified. Acute peritonitis is associated
with decreased intestinal motility, resulting in distention of the intestinal lumen with gas and
fluid. The accumulation of fluid in the bowel together with the lack of oral intake leads to rapid
intravascular depletion with effects on cardiac, renal, and other systems.

Chronic peritonitis refers to longstanding inflammation of the peritoneum. Causes include
repeated attacks of infection such as from pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Metastatic lesions
or foreign substances that induce inflammation, and chronic infections within the abdomen such
as Tuberculosis.

Diagnosis
     Acute peritonitis is usually characterized by acute abdominal pain and tenderness,
         dehydration, fever, hypotension, nausea and vomiting and tachycardia.
     Complications include abscess formation, oliguria and shock.
     Similar features may be seen in spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which occurs in
         cirrhotic patients with ascites. Bacterial translocation, bacteraemia and impaired
         antimicrobial activity contribute to its development. Gram negative bacilli (E. coli)
         commonly are a causative microbe.

Diagnostic considerations: (specific)
     Peritoneal fluid analysis for microscopy, microbiology, culture and sensitivity
     Macroscopic evaluation of the peritoneal fluid will exclude hemoperitoneum in trauma
         cases
     Blood cultures due to bacterimia
     Scanning procedures (ultrasound and/or CT scan) facilitates the diagnosis, Abdominal
         having the highest diagnostic yield.

61 | P a g e
Treatment considerations
Surgery remains a cornerstone of peritonitis treatment.

Antimicrobial therapy is adjunctive to surgical correction of underlying lesion or process and
treatment will depend on causative agent.
Where cause is not known antibiotics of choice are:

                   C: Ampicillin (I.V) 1g every 6hours for 5-10 days
                                                 Plus

                   A: Gentamicin (I.V) 4 mg/kg/24 hours in 3 divided doses for 5-10 days
                                                 Plus

                   C: Metronidazole (I.V)/ (O) 400-600mg every 8 hours for 5-10 days.

Referral
     Patient needs referral to centers where surgical intervention is adequate (i.e. expertise
         and medical facility)
     Refer to TB section for TB peritonitis management.

2.9 Constipation

According to the Rome III criteria for constipation, a patient must have experienced at least 2
of the following symptoms over the preceding 3 months: Fewer than 3 bowel movements per
week; straining; lumpy or hard stools; sensation of anorectal obstruction; sensation of
incomplete defecation, manual maneuvering required defecating.

Constipation is a symptom, not a disease. Contributory factors may include inactivity, low fiber
diet and inadequate water intake. Specific causes may include, conditions associated with
neurologic dysfunction, scleroderma, drugs, hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia,
Cushing's syndrome, colonic tumours, anorectal pain, and psychological factors.

Diagnosis
     Fewer than three bowel movements per week, small, hard, dry stools that is difficult or
         painful to pass, need to strain excessively to have a bowel movement, frequent use of
         enemas, laxatives or suppositories are characteristic.
     Other features may include; abdominal bloating, rectal bleeding, spurious diarrhea, low
         back pain, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and tenesmus.

Referral
The following signs and symptoms, if present, are grounds for urgent evaluation or referral:

     Rectal bleeding
     Abdominal pain
     Inability to pass flatus
     Vomiting
     Unexplained weight loss.

Diagnostic guides:
An extensive work up of the constipated patient is performed on an outpatient basis and usually
occurs after approximately 3-6 months of failed medical management. It is advised to refer the
patient at this juncture to specialized centers.

62 | P a g e
Laboratory evaluation may include a complete blood count (CBC), fecal occult blood especially
in middle-aged or elderly adults; Thyroid function tests, serum chemistry to exclude metabolic
causes of constipation.

Imaging studies are used to rule out acute processes that may be causing colonic ileus or to
evaluate causes of chronic constipation. Lower gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, colonic transit
study, defecography, anorectal manometry, surface anal electromyography (EMG), and balloon
expulsion may be used in the evaluation of constipation.

In the acute situation with a patient at low risk who usually is not constipated, no further
evaluation is necessary. Consider sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or barium enema for colorectal
cancer screening in patients older than 50 years. Colonoscopy represents the current criterion
standard.

Treatment guide:
· Find out the type of food taken by patient.
· Exclude other organic causes of partial bowel obstruction.
· Encourage high fibre diet, adequate fluid intake.
· Give laxatives as required but avoid chronic use.

Stimulant laxative
                   A: Bisacodyl (PO) 5-10mg
                             OR
                   A: Bisacodyl suppository (PR) 10mg at bed-time

Osmotic laxative
                   C: Lactulose solution (3.1 ­ 3.7g/ml) (O); Adults 15ml, 12 hourly; Children under
                   one year 2.5ml, 12 hourly; Children 1 ­ 5 years 5ml, 12 hourly and Children 5 ­
                   10 years 10ml, 12 hourly.

2.10 Hemorrhoids

Hemorrhoid disease is due to enlargement or thrombosis of the veins in the external or internal
hemorrhoidal plexus. The internal hemorrhoids are graded into four groups:

     Bleeding with defecation
     Prolapses with defecation but return naturally to their normal position
     Prolapses any time especially with defecation and can be replaced manually
     Permanently prolapsed.

Diagnosis
The most common presentation of hemorrhoids is rectal bleeding, pain, pruritus, or prolapse.
However, these symptoms are nonspecific and may be seen in a number of anorectal diseases.
A thorough history is needed to help narrow the differential diagnosis and adequate physical
examination to confirm the diagnosis.

Diagnostic considerations
     Anoscopy is mandatory for viewing internal hemorrhoids
     Flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed to exclude proximal disease

63 | P a g e
Treatment
The following is a quick summary of treatment for internal hemorrhoids by grade:

     Grade I hemorrhoids are treated with conservative medical therapy and avoidance of
         non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and spicy or fatty foods

     Grade II or III hemorrhoids are initially treated with nonsurgical procedures
         (sclerotherapy, band ligation)

     Very symptomatic grade III and grade IV hemorrhoids are best treated with surgical
         hemorrhoidectomy

     Treatment of grade I.V internal hemorrhoids or any incarcerated or gangrenous tissue
         requires prompt surgical consultation

External hemorrhoid symptoms are generally divided into problems with acute thrombosis and
hygiene/skin tag complaints. The former respond well to office excision (not enucleation), while
operative resection is reserved for the latter. Therapy is directed solely at the symptoms, not at
aesthetics.

Supportive management
· Treat any identified causative condition
· Encourage high fibre diet
· Careful anal hygiene
· Saline baths
· Avoid constipation by using stool softener.

Drugs of choice
Steroids and local anesthetics aims to reduce inflammation and provide relief during painful
defication. Refer preparations and dosing in cap. 2.10 below.

2.11 Anal fissures

These are painful linear ulcers in the anal canal. Young and middle aged adults most commonly
affected. Primary fissure occur in the posterior midline. It can also be secondary to Crohn's
disease, anal cancer, or infection such as syphilis, TB in which case they occur more lateral.
Passage of hard stools is a common predisposition to primary fissures.

Diagnosis
The hall mark is severe sharp pain during and after defecation with/out bright red bleeding.

Diagnostic consideration
Perform digital rectal examination or protoscopy, which must be done with topical anesthesia.

Treatment Guide
     Stools must be made soft and easy to pass; ensure high fluid intake, use osmotic
         laxatives such as Lactulose 20 mls 12 hrly (O)
     Topical anesthetics (Lidocaine jelly 2% - applied 12 to 8 hrly anal area with frequent
         seat baths reduces sphincter spasm.
     Vasodilator treatment with topical isosorbide mononitrate 1% or diltiazem 2% - applied
         12 hrly anal area, is effective at increasing fissure healing rate and it is the first line of
         management.

64 | P a g e
     If the fissure in few weeks surgical sphicterotomyis indicated to lower the sphincter
         tone.

2.12 Pruritus Ani

Also known as anusitis is the irritation of the skin within perianal region, the intensity of anal
itching increases from moisture, pressure, and rubbing caused by clothing and sitting. At worst,
anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is accompanied by burning and soreness.
Causes include:

     Benign anorectal condition such as hemorrhoids or anal fissure
     Neoplasia such as anal cancer, pagets disease
     Dermatological disease e.g. dermatitis, lichen sclerosis
     Infection: Candida, thread worm
     Some dietary components e.g coffee

Treatment guides
     Treat underling condition
     Short term use of steroid - Predinisone Caproate Ointment applied 12 hrly or suppository
         applied once daily is recommended.
     Proper hygiene and to wear cotton under wear
     Avoid hot and spicy foods.

3.0 DISORDERS OF THE LIVER AND BILLIARY TRACT

3.1 Hepatitis

This is a medical condition defined by the inflammation of the liver and characterized by the
presence of inflammatory cells in the tissue of the organ. The condition can be self-limiting or
can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Hepatitis may occur with limited or no symptoms, but
often leads to jaundice, anorexia and malaise. Hepatitis is acute when it lasts less than six
months and chronic when it persists longer. A group of hepatotropic viruses cause most cases
of hepatitis worldwide, but it can also be due to other viral infections( e.g Cytomegalo, Epstein
­Barr, Coxsackie viruses), toxins notably alcohol, certain medications, some industrial organic
solvents and plants, autoimmune diseases and metabolic disease.

3.1.1 Acute Viral Hepatitis
It is a systemic infection affecting the liver predominantly. Almost all cases of acute viral
hepatitis are caused by one of five hepatotropic viral agents: Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis
B virus (HBV), HBV ­ associated delta agent or Hepatitis D virus (HDV), and Hepatitis E virus
(HEV).

Diagnosis
Acute infection with a hepatitis virus may result in conditions ranging from subclinical disease to
self-limited symptomatic disease to fulminant hepatic failure.

Collectively patients may develop fever, anorexia, malaise, jaundice, abdominal pain after
specific incubation periods; and in severe forms signs of acute liver failure including altered
consciousness may be present.

65 | P a g e
Diagnostic guides
Quantitative analysis for presence of specific antibodies and/or antigenemia is mandatory for
establishing a specific causative viral agent. The severity of liver injury is determined by
transaminases levels (ALT) in particular, and more precisely by liver biopsy. The viremia is
determined through PCR method and for some viral subtypes through genotyping.

Treatment guides
Acute infection is usually self limiting, especially for HAV, HEV, and only 80% of HBV, and 20%
of HCV cases. Supportive management is all that is required during acute illness, except in
fulminant cases where specific antiviral medication may be required.

Note: Refer all cases of suspected Hepatitis to referral centers for expertise management.

3.1.2 Chronic viral Hepatitis
There is an on going inflammatory reaction in the liver for at least 6 months. The most common
causative hepatropic viral agents are HBV, HCV, and HDV. Non viral cause may include, drugs
(methyldopa, Isoniazid), autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, -
antitrypsin deficiency. Notably disease chronicity can progress into liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular cancer in span of years if no early treatment is initiated.

Diagnosis
     There is a wide clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic serum amino-
         transaminases elevations to apparently acute and even fulminant hepatitis.
     Common symptoms include, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, low grade fever; jaundice is
         frequent in severe disease.
     Some patients may present with complications of cirrhosis: ascites, variceal bleeding,
         encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hypersplenism. Some extra hepatic features may
         also predominate.(urticaria, arthritis, vasculitis, polyneuropathy, glomerulonephritis,
         thyroditis)

Diagnostic guides:
In addition to the above guides, surveillance studies for development of cirrhosis and its
complications or HCC include utrasonography, CT scan, serum  - feto protein.

Treatment

              B: Lamuvidine 150mg (O) once daily.
                      OR

              B: Tenofovir 300mg (O) once daily

              Treatment is long term (48- 96 weeks)
              Combination therapy is indicated in HIV co infected patients.

 HCV is treated by Inj. Pegylated interferon (180µg S.C) in combination with Tabs
    Rebavirin 800mg/day (O) in devided dose for genotype 2&3 or 1000mg/day(O) in
    devided dose for genotype 1,4,5 up to 48 weeks.

 Note: Referral of these patients to specialized centers for expertise management is
    highly recommended.

66 | P a g e
3.2 Liver Cirrhosis
This is a common end point of many causes of liver diseases; commonly caused by chronic
hepatitis B & C and alcoholic liver disease. Other causes include autoimmune hepatitis and
metaboloic liver disease. It is a histological diagnosis characterized by hepatic fibrosis and
nodule formation. Depending on etiologic process the progression of liver injury to cirrhosis may
occur over weeks to years. Clinical classification of the disease using Child- Tourcotte- Pugh
score is used to determine a 1-year mortality and need for liver transplantation.

Diagnostic features
     Include jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites, features of increased estrogen levels in men,
         while in women there are features of increased androgen levels. Loss of libido, testicular
         atrophy and impotence are common among male cirrhotic.
     In women predominant features are breast atrophy, menstrual disturbances including
         amenorrhea. Features of portal hypertension like splenomegaly, ascites, distended
         abdominal wall vessels and variceal bleeding are common.
     Hepatic encephalopathy and renal dysfunction is a sequel of associated complications.

Diagnostic guides
To include, complete blood count, liver functions, serum electrolytes, viral hepatitis panel (B, C,
and D), autoimmune markers (AMA,ANA), and makers for associated metabolic disease
(ceruloplasmin, ferritin), alpha fetoprotein, Imaging (ultrasonography with Doppler studies, CT,
MRI) and Liver biopsy.

Treatment Guide
In compensated cirrhosis:
 Treat the cause and associated complications.
 Encourage high calorie diet and protein intake.

In decompensate cirrhosis:
 Treat specifically the manifestation of hepatic decompansation. e.g. ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, GI bleeding, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
 Liver transplantation is definitive treatment once an episode of decompansation has occurred.

Note
It is advisable to refer patients with this condition to specialized centers for proper evaluation
and treatment. A planned supportive management can then be continued at the referring
centers.

3.3 Ascites of chronic liver disease

There is accumulation of fluid into peritoneal cavity; contributing factors includes portal
hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, hepatic lymph, hepatorenal syndrome.

Diagnosis
     May be asymptomatic if small amounts
     Abdominal distension and discomfort in increasing amounts, anorexia, nausea, early
         satiety, heartburn, flank pain, and respiratory distress.

Treatment guide:
Salt restriction < 2gm per day
C: Spironolactone 100- 200mg/ day(O); increase dose up to 400mg if fluid not mobilized

         despite low sodium diet ­ This is the first line therapy.

A: Furosemide 40mg/day (O) is added to spironolactone at ratio 2.5:1 up to maximum
         dose 160mg/day.

Note: Dose of each medication can be increased every 1- 2 weeks to the maximum doses
         indicated.

         Monitor weight reduction (targeted at 0.5 and 1kg/day if peripheral edema is present),
         urinary Na and K, serum electrolytes and creatinine.
     If ascites still present despite the above measures, manage the condition as refractory
         ascites where large volume parecentensis is indicated with concurrent infusions of
         albumin (10g/L of ascites removed)
     Liver transplantation is the definitive management.

3.4 Cholestatic Jaundice

Cholestasis is a symptom of many diseases. It is defined as a pathologic state of reduced bile
formation or flow. The mechanisms of cholestasis can be broadly classified into hepatocellular
(Intrahepatic), where an impairment of bile formation occurs, and obstructive (extra hepatic),
where impedance to bile flow occurs after it is formed.

Intrahepatic causes of cholestasis include viral hepatitis, alcohol, primary biliary cirrhosis, drug
toxicity, Hodgkin's lymphoma and pregnancy. Extra hepatic causes which may be amenable to
surgical correction include choledocholithiasis and carcinoma of the biliary tree. Parasitic
infections such as Ascariasis may also cause cholestatic jaundice

Diagnosis
     The prominent features include jaundice, dark urine, pale stools, and itching/pruritis.

Diagnostic considerations

     Liver functions; for elevated serum levels of total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline
         phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, bile salt concetration

     Elevated serum cholesterol
     Elevated fecal fat levels.
     Imaging and endoscopic studies. (USS, MRI, MRCP, ERCP, PTC)
     Liver biopsy.

Treatment
     Identify and treat specific cause
     Some medical care is directed at cholestasis and its consequences:

                   D: Cholestyramine (O) 4 -16g daily relieves itching
                                       OR

                   D: Ursodeoxycholic acid (PO) 8-10 mg/kg/day (in 2 or 3 divided doses)

68 | P a g e
         Surgery is indicated for extrahepatic cholestasis.

Note
Refer patiets cholestatic liver disease to specialized centres, particularly if it is severe or
prolonged.

3.5 Hepatic encephalopathy

A clinical state associated with alteration in mental status and cognitive function occurring in the
presence of liver failure; it may be acute and reversible or chronic and progressive.Precipintants
of the condition include, GI bleeding, azotemia, constipation, high protein meal, hypokalemic
alkalosis, CNS depressant drugs (benzodiazepines and barbiturates.), hypoxia, hypercarbia,
sepsis.

Diagnosis
Confusion, slurred speech, flapping tremors, change in personality that can include being
violent and hard to manage to being sleepy and difficult to arouse (refer to grades of hepatic
encephalopathy by West Haven Criteria ­ grade 1-4).
Diagnostic guides

     Evaluation for extent and cause of liver injury need to be established especially for
                   patients in whom the diagnosis of liver disease has not been previously made

     Investigate to include: liver functions, complete blood count, serum electrolytes, blood
                   sugar

     Seek the precipitants including septic screen (culture of blood, urine, sputum, ascites);
                   exclude GI bleed ( HB, history of melena), or evidence of renal impairement
                   (urea, creatinine)

     Abdominal U/S or CT scan may show evidence of portal hypertension.

Treatment
General measures

     Identify and if possible eliminate the cause (e.g drugs, viral hepatitis, septicaemia
     Toxins, alcohol or upper G.I bleeding)
     Avoid use of all unnecessary drugs including diuretics and sedatives
     Provide non protein containing high calorie food (2000kCal/day)

Drug Treatment
Antibiotic treatment of choice:

                   D: Neomycin 4-12g/day (PO/NGT);
                                       OR

                   A: Metronidazole 400-500mg (PO)/ (IV) 8 hourly

Give laxatives to provoke diarrhea:
                   C: Magnesium sulphate (O) 4g with water twice daily
                                       OR
                   C: Lactulose solution 60 mls/day in 2-3 divided dose to ensure 2-4 soft stools
                   passed daily and carry out high bowel washout.

69 | P a g e
     Give dextrose 10% (I.V infusion) 3 litres/day with 2g (26mmol) potassium chloride
         added to every litre bag (if renal function is satisfatory).

     Check for any infection and treat immediately
     If signs of bleeding are present give

                   D: Vitamin K (I.V) 10mg
                                       Plus

                   S: Fresh Frozen Plasma initially
                                       Add

                   Platelets if count <20 x 10g/l and patient is still bleeding
     If ethanol etiology is suspected give:

                   C: Thiamine (I.V) 10mg before dextrose infusion and continue daily for 3 days.
Note: Hepatic encephalopathy is a medical emergency and requires referral to

         specialized and equipped centers for proper evaluation and management.

               RESPIRATORY DISEASE CONDITIONS

1.0 ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS (ARI)

1.1 Pneumonia

Pneumonia is the inflammation of the lung tissue. Pneumonia can either be primary (to the
causing organism) or secondary to pathological damage in the respiratory system. The
common causative organisms for pneumonia are bacterial (for example Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenza, and Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma pneumoiae,
viral or parasitic e.g Pneumocystis jirovecii. The important clinical features are high fever 39C,
dry or productive cough, central cyanosis, respiratory distress, chest pain and tachypnea.

1.1.1 Pneumonia in Children
For more details, refer also Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines

Diagnosis
For children under five years of age the important symptoms are coughing or difficult breathing.
Classification of pneumonia in children is based on respiratory rate whichis fast breathing and
chest in-drawing.
Fast breathing is defined as

 Respiratory rate>60 age less than 3 months
 Respiratory rate > 50 age between 3 months and 5 years
 Chest indrawing is when the lower part of the chest moves in when the child breaths in.

Table 1: Important clinical features of pneumonia in underfives

         No chest in-drawing              Cough or cold
         Less than 40 breaths per minute

General management
     Oxygen therapy if available
     Supportive care
         - Lower the temperature if 38.5oC, give Paracetamol

         - If wheezing giving rapid-acting bronchodilator: Nebulized Salbutamol

         - Ensure that the child receives daily maintenance fluid appropriate for the child's age
         but avoid over-hydration refer to IMCI/ STG & Essential medicines List for Children

Treatment of very severe pneumonia:
                   A: Ampicillin 50 mg/kg I.V/I.M every 6 hours
                                       Plus
                   A: Gentamicin (7.5 mg/kg I.V/I.M once a day) for 5 days;

If child responds well, complete treatment at home or in hospital with

                   A: Amoxicillin (15 mg/kg three times a day)
                                       Plus

                   A: Gentamicin 7.5 mg/kg I.M once daily for a further 5 days.
    Alternatively,

                   B: Chloramphenicol (25 mg/kg I.M or I.V every 6 hours) until the child has
         improved. Then continue orally 4 times a day for a total course of 10 days.
    If the child does not improve within 48 hours, switch to

                   A: Gentamicin (7.5mg/kg I.V/IM once a day)
                                       Plus

                   A: Cloxacillin (50 mg/kg IV or IM every 6 hours), then continue Cloxacillin orally
         4 times a day for a total course of 3 weeks.

 If the child is not improving use ceftriaxone (80 mg/kg I.V or I.M once daily) for 10 days.
 For children above 5 years, atypical pneumonia should be considered e.g. mycoplasma. A

    macrolide (Erythromycin OR Azythromycin) should be considered as a drug of choice in
    addition to the above antibiotics or as a second line treatment.

Severe pneumonia

                   A: Benzyl Penicillin 50 000 units/kg I.V or I.M every 6 hours for at least 3 days
                   THEN

                   A: Amoxicillin 15 mg/kg 8 hourly for 7 days.

 If the child does not improve within 48 hours, or deteriorates, look for complications and
    treat accordingly. If there are no apparent complications, switch to

72 | P a g e
    B: Chloramphenical (25 mg/kg every 6 hours I.V or I.M) until the child has
improved. Then continue orally for a total course for 10 days.

Non-severe pneumonia
                   A: Amoxicillin 25 mg/kg 12 hourly for 5 days

 Give the first dose at the clinic and teach the mother how to give the other doses at home.
 Encourage breasting and feeding.

2.0 Bronchospasm

This is a contraction of smooth muscle in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles, causing
narrowing of the lumen

2.1 Wheezing

Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound heard near the end of expiration. It is caused by
spasmodic narrowing of the distal airways. Sometimes children with pneumonia present with
wheeze.

In a young infant below 3 months, wheezing is a sign of serious illness - REFER IMMEDIATELY
to a higher level if the condition cannot be managed at your facility.

Wheezing for infants between 3 and 12 months may be due to bronchiolitis, a viral infection ­
REFER to a higher level if the condition cannot be managed at your facility .

74 | P a g e
In Children more than 1 year wheezing may be due to asthma, refer to section on asthma. If
the child is in distress, give a rapid-acting bronchodilator (see section on asthma) and REFER to
a higher level if the condition cannot be managed at your facility.

General management
          If the child has fever (>39o C) give Paracetamol
          Give Oxygen to all children with wheezing and severe respiratory distress
          Give daily maintenance fluids appropriate for the child's age
          Encourage breast-feeding & oral fluids
          Encourage the child to eat as soon as food can be eaten
         

Treatment
Bronchodialator in Children 1-5 years

         If a rapid acting bronchodilator is required drugs of choice: Adrenaline (1:1000) 0.01
         ml/kg body weight by subcutaneous (SC) injection up to maximum of 0.25 ml may be
         repeated after 20 minutes.

Oral bronchodilator (for Children 1-5 years) Salbutamol (O) 0.4 mg/kg/day divided in 3-4 doses
for 5 days.

2.2 Asthma

Diagnosis/ Clinical features: Asthma is a reversible obstructive airways disease of varying
severity. The symptoms are caused by constriction of bronchial smooth muscle
(bronchospasm), oedema of bronchial mucous membrane and blockage of the smaller bronchi
with plug of mucus. It can be triggered by factors like allergens, infections, exercise, drugs e.g.
Aspirin, tobacco smoke, inhaled chemicals etc. It is characterized by dyspnea, wheezing,
tightness of the chest and cough.

Management guidelines
          Maintenance therapy should be adequate
          Treatment of acute attacks
          Avoid heavy exercise

         NOTE: The management of asthma in children is similar to that in adults. Infants under
         18 months, however, may not respond well to bronchodilator

Asthma attack/ acute asthma
Acute asthma is a substantial worsening of asthma symptoms. The severity and duration of
attacks are variable and unpredictable. Assessment of the severity of asthma must be rapidly
evaluated using the following clinical criteria (not all signs are necessarily present)

Nocturnal Asthma
Patients who get night attacks should be advised to take their medication on going to bed.

Chronic Asthma in Adults
The assessment of the frequency of daytime and nighttime symptoms and limitation of physical
activity determines whether asthma is intermittent or persistent. There are 4 categories (see
table).

Therapy is step-wise (Step 1-4) based on the category of asthma and consists of:

     Preventing the inflammation leading to bronchospasm (controllers)
     Relieving bronchospasm (relievers)
Controller medicines in asthma
       Inhaled corticosteroids e.g. Beclomethasone
Reliever medicines in asthma
       2 agonists e.g. Salbutamol (short-acting)

3 0 BRONCHITIS

3.1 Acute bronchitis

It is a self-limited inflammation of the bronchi due to upper airway infection. Acute bronchitis is
one of the most common conditions associated with antibiotic misuse. This respiratory condition
is generally caused by a virus. Pertussis is the only indication for antibacterial agents in the
treatment of acute bronchitis.

Diagnosis
     Patients with acute bronchitis present with a cough lasting more than five days (typically
         one to three weeks), which may be associated with sputum production.
     Acute bronchitis should be distinguished from chronic bronchitis (see below), it is not a
         form of COPD.

Symptomatic treatment
     with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Paracetamol, Aspirin
     cough suppressant syrups
     There is NO benefit from antibiotic use

3.2 Chronic Bronchitis

It defined by a chronic productive cough for three months in each of two successive years in a
patient in whom other causes of chronic cough have been excluded. Patients may get
secondary bacterial infection with development of fever and production of thick smelly sputum.

Non Pharmaceutical Treatment
     Stop smoking and/or remove from hazardous environment
     Prompt treatment of infective exacerbations

78 | P a g e
     Controlled oxygen therapy
     Physiotherapy
     Bronchodilator may give some benefit

Pharmaceutical Treatment
     Give -agonist e.g. Salbutamol (O) 4-8mg 6 ­ 8 hourly
                             OR
                   D: Ipratropium bromide aerosol 20 ­ 80mg, 6 ­ 8 hourly
     Trial of streroids if there is any possibility of reversible airways obstructions
                   A: Prednisolone (O) 20mg once daily for 5 days

4.0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Definition.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterized by chronic
obstruction of lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing and is not fully reversible
(WHO)

Clinical symptoms and signs.

     Chronic cough and sputum production often precede the development of airflow
         limitation by many years.

     Abnormal shortness of breath and increased forced expiratory time

A COPD diagnosis

     Diagnosed based on factors such as signs/symptoms, patient history, physical
         examination, chest X-rays.

     Is confirmed by a simple test called spirometry, which measures how deeply a person
         can breathe and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs.

COPD Exacerbations: a sustained worsening of the patient's condition, from the stable state
and beyond normal day-to-day variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in
regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD.

Additionally, a generalized sub classification of exacerbations based on health-care utilization is
proposed.

     Mild: patient has an increased need for medication, which he/she can manage in his/her
         own normal environment.

     Moderate: patient has an increased need for medication, and he/she feels the need to
         seek additional medical assistance.

     Severe: patient/caregiver recognizes obvious and/or rapid deterioration in condition,
         requiring hospitalization.

79 | P a g e
   Clinical signs and symptoms.

         Increased dyspnoea,
         Productive cough with altered sputum
         Fever.
         Alternatively, the symptoms may be more nonspecific, such as malaise, fatigue,

             insomnia or sleepiness, and depression.

   The major diseases included in this category are:

   Chronic bronchitis - a chronic, inflammatory condition of the bronchi characterized by
       coughing and expectoration (spitting-up) of sputum (mucous coughed-up from the lungs)
       occurring on most days and lasting 3 months or longer for at least two consecutive years.

   Emphysema - a respiratory disorder that is characterized by enlargement and eventual
       destruction of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs, through which oxygen passes from the lungs
       into the bloodstream.

   Bronchiectasis is characterized by inflamed and easily collapsible airways, obstruction to
       airflow, and frequent hospital visits and admissions. (See below).

   Although asthma is also a condition that is associated with airway obstruction, and many
       people with COPD also suffer with asthma, as a general rule, asthma is not included under
       the category of COPD.

 Non pharmacological treatment:
 The role of supplemental treatments in the management of patients with COPD, including:

          Pulmonary rehabilitation
          Patient education
          Psychosocial support
          Nutrition
          Supplemental oxygen therapy

 Pharmacological treatment
          The major types of medications that are often prescribed for patients with stable
             COPD, which include:
          Inhaled bronchodilators
          Inhaled corticosteroids
          Theophylline.

Surgical treatment options for the treatment of patients with advanced emphysema, which
include:

          Bullectomy
          Lung-volume reduction surgery
          Lung transplantation

5.0 OTHER RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS

5.1 Acute laryngo-tracheobronchitis/Croup

Clinical features: Croup is acute inflammation of the larynx, trachea and bronchi which
occurs in young children (usually between 6 months to 3 years of age). It arises as a result of
narrowing of the airway in the region of the larynx. The most common cause is viral infection
(particularly parainfluenza viruses) but may also be due to bacterial infection. The obstruction
is due to inflammation and oedema.

Diagnosis
     The symptoms include paroxysmal "barking" cough, insipiratory stridor, fever, wheezing,
         hoarseness of voice and tachypnoea
     Such symptoms usually occur at night
     Respiratory failure and pneumonia are potentially fatal complications.

General management
     Prevent asphyxiation
     Treat inflammatory edema
     Humidification of inhaled air
     Hospitalization may be necessary

Note
     No stridor at rest, give no antibiotics
     Stridor at rest or chest in-drawing or fast breathing REFER IMMEDIATELY to hospital

Mild Croup
     Only stridor when upset, no moderate/severe ARI
     Likely of viral origin
     Home care ­ steam inhalation
     Antibiotics NOT required

Severe Croup
     Likely bacterial origin
     Stridor in a calm child at rest
     Chest in drawing
     Antibiotics are NOT effective and should not be given

Treatment
Admit to hospital, give Oxygen therapy to all patients with chest in-drawing (using nasal prongs
only, DO NOT use nasopharyngeal or nasal catheter) until the lower chest wall in-drawing is no
longer present

                   C: Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg orally daily in 1-2 divided doses
                                       Plus

                   C: Nebulized Adrenaline (400 mcg/kg) every 2 hours if effective; repeat after 30
                   min if necessary.

81 | P a g e
5.2 Laryngeal Diphtheria

Is an infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria; it is directly transmitted from person to
person by droplets. Children between 1-5 years of age are most susceptible although non-
immune adults are also at risk.

Diagnosis
Diphtheria is characterized by grayish-white membrane, composed of dead cells, fibrin,
leucocytes and red blood cells as a result of inflammation due to multiplying bacteria.

General management
          Isolate the child
          Gently examine the child's throat ­ can cause airway obstruction if not carefully
              done.
          NGT for feeding if unable to swallow
          Avoid oxygen unless there is incipient airway obstruction
          May need tracheostomy if there is incipient airway obstruction

Treatment
Drug of choice

                   A: Penicillin V (250 mg four times daily) for a total treatment course of 14 days
                                                 OR

                   A: Erythromycin 125-250 mg every 6 hours for 14 days
                                              OR

                   C: Azithromycin 125-500mg daily for 3 days
                                                 OR

                   A: Penicillin G (Benzyl Penicillin) 25,000 to 50,000 units/kg to a maximum of 1.2
                   MU IV every 12 hours until the patient can take oral medicine)

                                              Plus
Diphtheria antitoxin (IM or slow IV) dose depends upon the site and severity of infection:

     First give a test dose of 0.1ml of 1 in 10 dilution of antitoxin in 0.9% Sodium Chloride
         intradermally to detect hypersensitivity

     It should be given immediately because delay can lead to increased mortality
     The dose should be administered intravenously over 60 minutes in order to inactivate

         toxin rapidly
     20,000 to 40,000 units for pharyngeal/laryngeal disease of <48 hours duration,
     40,000 to 60,000 units for nasopharyngeal disease
     80,000 to 120,000 units for >3 days of illness or diffuse neck swelling ("bull-neck")

         NOTE Tracheostomy may be required for airways obstruction

5.3 Whooping Cough

It is a highly infectious childhood disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is most severe in
young infants who have not yet been immunized.

Diagnosis
     After an incubation period of 7 ­10 days, the child develops fever, usually with a cough
         and nasal discharge which are clinically indistinguishable from a common cough and cold

82 | P a g e
     In the second week, there is paroxysmal coughing which can be recognized as pertussis
     The episodes of coughing can continue for 3 months or longer
     The child is infectious for a period of 2 weeks up to 3 months after the onset of illness
     The main clinical feature is paroxysmal cough associated with a whoop.

General management
 During paroxysms of coughing, place the child head down and prone, or on the side, to

    prevent any inhaling of vomitus and to aid expectoration of secretions.
 Care for the airway but avoid, as far as possible, any procedure that could trigger coughing,

    such as application of suction, throat examination
 Do not give cough suppressants, sedatives, mucolytic agents or anti-histamines.
 If the child has fever (>38.50C) give paracetamol.
 Encourage breastfeeding or oral fluids
 Whooping cough is preventable by immunization with pertussis vaccine contained in DPT

    triple vaccine.
 Admit infants aged less than 6 months to hospital; also admit any child with pneumonia,

    convulsions, dehydration, severe malnutrition, or prolonged apnoea or cyanosis after
    coughing.

Treatment
Antibiotics

                   A: Erythromycin 12.5 mg/kg (PO) every 6 hours for 10 days.

              This does not shorten the illness but reduces the period of infectiousness

    If there is fever or if erythromycin is not available
                  A: Chloramphenicol 25 mg/kg (PO) every 8 hours for 5 days

Oxygen
         Give oxygen to children who have spells of apnoea or cyanosis, or severe paroxysms of
         coughing.

 Use nasal prongs, not a nasopharyngeal catheter or nasal catheter which can provoke
    coughing.

5.4 Bronchiectasis

Bronchiectasis is characterized by inflamed and easily collapsible airways, obstruction to airflow,
and frequent hospital visits and admissions.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is usually established clinically on the basis of chronic daily cough with viscid
sputum production, and radiographically by the presence of bronchial wall thickening and
luminal dilatation on chest x-rays.

General management
 Antibiotics are used to treat an acute exacerbation and prevent recurrent infection by

    suppression or eradication of existing flora.
 Physiotherapy and postural drainage
 Avoid smoking

83 | P a g e
 Respiratory care during childhood measles helps prevent the development of bronchiectasis
    in children

Treatment
Management of bronchiectasis is aimed at treating the underlying cause (eg, removal of an
airway foreign body or treatment of aspiration or humoral immunodeficiency), improving
mucocilliary clearance, treating and preventing infection, and controlling inflammation.

Acute excarcebation
Adults

                   A: Ciprofloxacin 500mg every 12 hours for 7-10 days

                   A: Metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5-7 days

Prevention of infection
                   A: Ciprofloxacin 500mg (PO) once daily for 7 ­ 14 days/ month
                                       OR
                   A: Erythromycin (PO) once 250-500mg for 7-14days/month

5.5 Lung abscess

Lung abscess is a cavity within the lung parenchyma filled with necrotic tissues which occurs as
a result of tissue-destroying infection.

Diagnosis
It is characterized by high fever, breathlessness, cough productive of large amounts of foul-
smelling sputum and haemoptysis.

General management
Postural drainage

Treatment
                   C: Ampicillin (start with IV then oral) 500-1000mg every 8 hours for 4-6 weeks

         (children 50mg/kg/dose)
                                       Plus

CAUTION
     Avoid taking both drugs concomitantly if sides effects are intolerable
     Avoid metrondazole in the first trimester
     Avoid alcohol while taking metronidazole

2.0 ABORTION

It is interruption of pregnancy (expulsion of a fetus) before it is viable, legally at 28th week of
gestation. Clinical types are recognized according to findings when the patient is first seen.
These include: Threatened abortion, inevitable abortion, incomplete abortion, complete
abortion and missed abortion.

Diagnosis
     Clinical features will depend on the types of abortion
     Viginal bleeding which may be very heavy in incomplete abortion, intermittent pain
         which ceases when abortion is complete and cervical dilation in inevitable abortion
     In missed abortion, dead ovum retained for several weeks while sympoms and signs of
         pregnancy disappear
     When infected (septic abortion) patient presents with fever tachycardia, offensive
         vaginal discharge, pelvic and abdominal pain.

Puerperal/Post abortal Sepsis
Pyrexia in women who has delivered or miscarried in the previous 6 weeks may be due to
puerperal or abortal sepsis and should be managed actively. Abdominal pain in addition to
pyrexia is strongly suggesstive. The uterus may need evacuation however parenteral antibiotics
must be administered before evacuation.

8.0 DIABETES IN PREGNANCY

Gestational diabetes develops in women during pregnancy because of insulin resistance or
insensitivity due to steroid hormones produced from the placenta. High blood sugar levels in the
mother's body are passed through the placenta to the developing baby. This can cause health
problems. Gestational diabetes usually begins in the second half of pregnancy and goes away
after the baby is born.

Management
     Diabetic pregnant women require management before and throughout pregnancy
     Diabetes should be controlled by diet,oral hypoglycaemics and or Insulin
     Throughout pregnancy blood sugar should strictly be within the range of 4-6 mmol/L
     Insulin requirement will increase as pregnancy progresses
     During labour check blood sugar 4hourly in order to detect hypoglycaemia and manage
         accordingly
     When labour induced give half the usual insulin dose first and start on IV infusion of
         dextrose 5% at 125 ml per hour
     Manage the aptient on a sliding scale of insulin after labour
     Continue to monitor blood sugar after delivery in order to adjust insulin requirement

9.0 HEART BURN IN PREGNANCY

Heartburn (also called acid indigestion or acid reflux) is a burning sensation that often extends
from the bottom of the breastbone to the lower throat. It's caused by some of the hormonal
and physical changes in pregnant women.

Management
Pregnant women should avoid:

     Food and beverages that cause gastrointestinal distress
     Tobacco and alcohol
     Eating big meals; should eat several small meals throughout the day
     Drinking large quantities of fluids during meals
     Eat close to bedtime; they should give themselves two to three hours to digest food

         before they lie down
     Sleep propped up with several pillows or a wedge. Elevating upper body will help keep

         the stomach acids where they belong and will aid food digestion.

Treatment

              A: Magnesium trisilicate (O) as needed
                                 OR

              C: Omeprazole 20 -40 once a day

93 | P a g e
10.0 RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYDROME

Respiratory Distress Syndrome is likely to occur in newborn and in premature labour before 36
weeks gestation.

Drug of choice
                   B: Hydrocortisome (IV) 250 mg repeats after 24 hours
                                                 OR
                   D: Dexamethasome (IV) 12 mg, two doses at an interval of 12 hours.

         Note: If no delivery the course can be repeated after one week

         CATION: Anemic patients under Beta stimulants and steroids are inclined to
                   congestive cardiac failure

11.0 STIMULATION OF LABOUR AND MYOMETRIAL RELAXATION

     Mycometrial stimulants should be used with great care before delivery especially in
         porous women

     Use in obstructed labour should be avoided
     Oxytocics are indicated for:-

              o augmentation of labour
              o Induction of labour
              o Active management of third stage of labour.
              o Uterine stimulation after delivery

11.1 Labour Induction

For induction of labour use: Oxytocin IV the dose will depend on parity.
     Primigravida:
                   A: Oxytocin IV 5 IU in 500mls of fluid titrate at 15, 30, 60 drops per minute until
                   desired uterine contractions are attained
     Multiparous:
                   A: Oxytocin IV Starts with low dose eg 1.25 IU in 500mls of fluid titrate as
         above. Regulate the dose according to response.

If no progress of labour is achieved give;

                   A: Oxytocin (IV) Initially 1 unit then 4 units in 1 litre Normal Saline at 15, 30, 60
                   drops per minute until regular contractions lasting for more than 40 secondly are
                   maintained
When 4 units are not enough to cause maintained constractions, and it is first pregnancy, the
dose can be increased to 16, 32 then 64 units in litre of Normal Saline each time increasing the
delivery rate through 15, 30 and 60 dpm.

11.2 Augmentation of Labour

If labour progress is not optimum labour augumentation is necessary. Can be achieved by:
                   A: Oxytocin as above
                                       OR

94 | P a g e
                   Artificial rupture of membranes and Oxytocin
     If the membranes already ruptured and no labour progressing, the steps above should

         be followed
     Obstructed labour could be the cause of labour failure.
Note: Rule out obstruction before augumenting labour with oxytocin

11.3 Myometrial Stimulation after Delivery

Post partum hemorrhage (PPH)
It is an excessive bleeding of more than 500ml after the third stage of labour and a major cause
of maternal mordidity and mortaility.

Major causes are;
     Uterine atony
     Tears of the vagina/vulva
     Retained products of conception
     Rarely rupture of the uterus
     Bleeding disorder (e.g coagulopathies, DIC)

Management
In order to prevent the occurrence of this condition, active management of the third stage of
labour (ATMSL) is mandatory. This involves the injection of an oxytocic after the delivery of the
foetus followed by controlled cord traction and uterine massage.

Treatment
Drugs of Choice:

                   A: Oxytocin (I.M) 10 I.U.
                                       OR

                   A: Ergometrine (I.M) 0.25 ­ 0.5 mg
                                       OR

                   A: Misoprostol 800 -1000 microgram (mcg) orally/rectally

Give Oxytocin (I.M) 5 units after delivery of the infant; when no response gives Oxytocin (I.V
infusion) 10-20 units in 1 litre of NS running at 10-20 drops per minute (dpm)

Second Choice: Ergometrine (IM) 0.5 mg after delivery of the infant, in the absence of
myometrial contraction and to prevent postparum hemorrhage

         Note: Use Ergometrine cautiously in hypertensive heart disease patients.

11.4 Myometrial Relaxation

This is done to relax the uterus in order to:
     Relieve fetal distress immediately prior to ceasarian section
     Stop contraction of uterine in premature labour
     Prevent uterine rupture
     Perform external cephalic version

95 | P a g e
Drug of Choice A: Salbutamol 4 mg (O) every 8 hours

         Note
          -stimulants should NEVER be used if the patient had an antepartum hemorrhage
          -stimulants are CONTRA-INDICATED for the following
          With cardiac disease
          Severe anemia in pregnancy

12.0 TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY

Abortion is illegal in Tanzania except under the following legal conditions:
     Where there is a substantial threat to the woman's health or life in continuing the
         pregnancy
     Where there is a significant risk or it is known that the foetus has a serious medical
         conditions or malformation
     Where the pregnancy results from rape and there is no intention to keep the pregnancy.

Recommended methods

 Routine Dilation and curettage  - up to 7 weeks since last menstrual period

 Suction termination ­ Between 7-12 weeks since the last menstrual period

 Prostaglandin termination ­ after 12 weeks since the last menstrual period.

13.0 PREGNANCY AND LACTATION

    General Guidelines
     All drugs, if possible, should be avoided during the first trimester
     Well known medicine and their use in pregnancy and lactation, which have been

         documented as safe, should be preferred ­ AVOID new drugs
     Absence from a list of medicine not to be used in pregnancy or lactation does not

         guarantee safety
     During pregnancy and lactation, medicines should be prescribed only if benefit

         overweighs risk to the foetus or neonate.

14.0 PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) occurs when there is infection in the female reproductive
organs. The infection can happen as an ascending infection from the vagina, after delivery
(puerperal sepsis), after an abortion (septic abortion), postmenstrual or after Dilation and
Curettage (D&C) operation. The common causative organisms are Neisseria gonorrhea,
Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis. Endogenous bacteria e.g. gram-negative
aerobes and anaerobes like bacteroides, streptococcus, anaerobic streptococcus and E. coli may
also cause PID. The condition can either be acute, sub-acute or chronic.

Diagnosis
The main clinical features are lower abdominal pain, backache, vomiting, vaginal discharge,
menstrual disturbance, dyspareunia, fever, infertility and tender pelvic masses. PID predisposes
to ectopic pregnancy.

96 | P a g e
Treatment
In acute PID gives Intravenous fluid (Ringers Lactate or Normal saline)

                   A: Ciprofloxacin (O) 500mg single dose,

15.0 HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION

Oral contraceptives (oestrogen ­ progestogen combinaitons) are used primarily for prevention
of conception. It may also be used in treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding,
dysmenorrhea or endometriosis.

The goal of therapy in the use of these products for contraception is to provide optional
prevention of pregnancy while minimizing the symptoms and long term risks associated with
excess or deficiency of the oestrogen and progestogen components.The eligibility for hormonal
contraception can be obtained from nearest family planning clinic or unit.

15.1 Oral Contraceptives

They fall into two major categories:

Combined oral contraceptives) COCs)
                   A: Oestrogen 30 ­ 35 micrograms (as ethinyloestradiol)

"Low Dose"
                   A: Oestrogen 50 micrograms + progestogen

" High Dose"
"Triphasic pills" ­ contain phased levels which closely mimic normal cyclical hormonal acitivity

                    Lower oestrogen dose pills cause fever side effects than higher dose pills
                    Mid-cycle spotting in patients on 30 microgram COCs can be managed by

                        changing to 50 microgram COCs
                    Menstruation on COCs will be regular, light and short

97 | P a g e
Progestogen Only Pills (POPs)
These contain norethisterone, or norethindrone or levonorgestrel. This type is suitable for
lactating mothers or women with mild or moderate hypertension. Menstrual irregularity is a
more common side effect.

Management
Follow up:

     Instruct women always to inform the doctor or nurse that they are on contraceptives
         while attending clinic or hospital.

     Women on Oral Contraceptives need regular physical check-ups including blood pressure
         measurement every six months e.g. if women develop depression after starting OC.

Need to Withdraw COCs or POPs
     Pregnancy
     Severe headaches especially associated with visual disturbances
     Numbness or paresis of extremities
     Unexplained chest pain or shortness of breath
     Severe leg pains
     Development of any of the absolute contra-indication conditions

Medicines Reducing the Effect of Oral Contraceptives
The following drugs are likely to reduce the effectiveness of OCs and woman may become
pregnant so the woman should be advised to use additional prevention method such as
condom.

     Hypnotic/sedatives anti-migraine medication, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, diazepam
     Antiacid: Aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate
     Anti TB as rifampicin
     Antiretroviral as Nevirapine and Retonavir
     Certain antibiotics as Ampicillin and other Penicillins and Tetracyclines.

         Note
          For long term use of these drug "High Dose" COCs ­ 50 micrograms should be used

              or other method of contraception

Drug made less effective by Oral Contraceptives
Prescribers might consider increasing the doses of the following drugs, known with careful
monitoring

     Anticonvulsant
     Ant diabetic agents
     Anticoagulants
     Antihypertensive agents (methyldopa)
     Corticosteroid
     Hypnotics, sedatives or other CNS depressants

Post Coital Contraception ("morning-after pill")
The method is applicable mostly after rape and unprotected sexual intercourse where
pregnancy is not desired.Within 3 days (72 hours) of unprotected sexual intercourse, give

98 | P a g e
                   A: Combined oral Contraceptive ethinyloestradiol 100 mcg and levonorgestrel
                   500 mcg (2 high dose COC tablets)

                                       OR
                   A: Ethinyloetradiol 30-35 mcg and levonorgestrel 150-250 mcg -3 tablets (3 low
                   dose COC tablets).
     Repeat this dose after twelve hours
     Advice to return to physician if menstruation does not occur within 3 weeks
     Give advice on contraceptive use
     Rape victims should also be given Erythromycin (O) 250 mg every 6 hours for 5 days
     Offer counseling

Long Term Hormonal Contraceptives
These contraceptives should be prescribed by Medical Doctors only or trained family planning
staff.

Injectable Contraceptive:
                   A: Medroxyprogesterone acetate IM 150 mg every three months

         CAUTION Avoid use in for severe hypertension and in women without proven
         fertility

Implant Contraceptive (see FP manual for current implants in use)
"Norplant" Containing levonorgestrel in six silastic capsules is implented in the left upper

         arm made local anesthesia.
"Norplant" Is effective for five years and is recommended for women who have completed
their family or nor ready for sterilization or those not able to take oestrogen containing
contraceptives.

Contraindications for Norplant
     Severe hypertension
     Thromboembolism
     Active liver disease
     Sickle cell anaemia
     Undiagnosed genital bleeding
     Severe headaches

16.0 ANTEPARTUM HAEMORRHAGE (APH)

         CAUTION all patients with APH must be managed in the hospital setting

Diagnosis
     Bleeding from the birth canal after the 28th week of gestation
     Main forms are placenta praevia and abruptio placenta
     Bleeding is painless in placenta praevia
     Bleeding may be visible or concealed in abruptio placenta
     Pain and shock in abruptio placenta correspond with degree of separation
     Placenta praevia

99 | P a g e
         Placenta attached at the lower segment characterized by painless vaginal bleeding
     Abruption placenta

         Premature separation of the placenta characterized by severe abdominal pain, shock,
         foetal distress or foetal death.

         General management
If patient is bleeding heavily or in shock:

     Vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature)
     IV line (two are better than one)
     Take blood (Grouping and cross matching, FBC, platelet count)
     Give (I.V) fluids quickly Ringer´s Lactate
     Give oxygen
     Send somebody for two or more units of blood
     Indwelling catheter
     Do ultrasound; if no placenta praevia, speculum and vaginal examination
     If rapid vaginal delivery is considered, prepare vacuum
     Add Oxytocin and amniotomy
     In most cases of placenta praevia CS is indicated. Give antibiotic prophylaxis before CS:

         Ampicillin 1g I.V (single dose)PLUS Metronidazole 500mg I.V (single dose)

If patient in good condition:
     Observe closely for signs of worsening
     Do ultrasound; if no placenta praevia, speculum and vaginal examination
     Consider prolongation of pregnancy to term

Follow Up after delivery
     Close monitoring (vital signs, shock symptoms, uterus size and consistency)
     Check Hb 48 hours after delivery
     Inform patient about history (risks for further pregnancies, mode of delivery)
     Discuss possible modes of contraception before discharge

         Management of Abruptio Placentae
          Open 2 IV lines
          Give Ringer Lactate or Normal Saline quickly
          Catheterization
          Blood grouping and crossmatch order enough blood
          Bed side clotting time
          In most cases there is already IUFD Induce with amniotomy and oxytocin infusion
          Give adequate analgesia

NB if the baby is alive at term or near term consider CS
     Expectant therapy
     Allow bed rest
     Blood grouping and cross-matching
     Active therapy delivery if foetus viable. If a major placental separation has occurred,
         emergency delivery to minimize the possibility of disseminated
     Intravascular coagulation

100 | P a g e
     Give blood when indicated.

17.0 DYSMENORRHOEA

Dysmenorrhoea is painful menstruation preventing normal activities and require medication.

There are 2 types of dysmenorrhoea:
     Primary (no organic cause). Typically, in primary dysmenorrhoea pain occurs on the first
         day of menses, usually about the time the flow begins, but it may not be present until
         the second day. Nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and headache may occur.

     Secondary (pathological cause) e.g. PID and uterine polyposis and membranous (cast
         of endometrial cavity shed as a single entity (rare).

Treatment
     Allow bed rest
     Give Analgesics such as
                   A: Ibuprofen 200-600 mg every 8 hours (maximum 2.4 g/day)
                                       OR
                   A: Acetylsalicylic acid 300-600 mg every 4 hours
                                       OR
                   A:Diclofenac 50-100mg 8-12 hourly
                                       OR
                   C: Mefenamic acid 500mg 8 hourly
                                       Plus
                   A: Hyoscine butylbromide 20mg 8hourly

         Women with regular complaints can easily detect length of use during their periods (2-3
         days usually sufficient)
     Treat the underlying condition if known

         Note: For primary dysmenorrhoea patients may be advised to start taking Ibuprofen
         one or two days before menses and continue for three to four days during menses to
         minimize painful menstruation

18.0 INFERTILITY
This is failure to conceive after one year of regular coitus without contraception. It is classified
as primary when there has never been a history of pregnancy or it is secondary when there is
previous history of at least one conception.

Treatment
Treatment in all cases depends upon correction of the underlying disorder(s) suspected of
causing infertility whether primary or secondary.

Note: Refer infertile couple to Obstetrics/Gynecologist/ infertility specialists

1.0 INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS (IE)

The infective process of endorcadial layer of the heart can involve native or prosthetic valve and
congenital defects/shunts.
Alpha-haemolytic streptococci are the most common causes of native valve endocarditis but
Staphylococcus aureus is more likely if the disease is rapidly progressive with high fever, or is
related to a prosthetic valve (Staphylococcus epidermidis)

Diagnosis: Use Modified Dukes Criteria below and consult microbiologist where possible.
Three sets of blood cultures should be taken before starting treatment.

Modified Dukes Criteria
Major Criteria

     Positive blood cultures of typical organism for IE from at least two separate blood
         cultures

     Evidence of endocardial involvement by Echocardiogram (Trans-thoracic Echo/Trans-
         oesophageal Echo)

Minor Criteria
     Fever > 38ºC
     Presence of Rheumatic Heart Disease, Congenital heart diseases
     Vascular phenomena; Major arterial emboli, Septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic

      where surgery is contemplated
      management of intractable heart failure or other non-responding complications
      pregnancy

Antibiotic prophylaxis after rheumatic fever:
Prophylaxis should be given to all patients with a history of acute rheumatic fever and to those
with rheumatic heart valve lesions. The optimum duration of prophylaxis is controversial, but
should be continued up to at least 21 years of age.

Note: Specific situations requiring prophylaxis for longer periods (up to 30 years as a guide):
      definite carditis in previous attacks
      high risk of exposure to streptococcal infection at home or work (crowded conditions,
          high exposure to children)

Medicines

3.0 VALVULAR HEART DISEASE AND CONGENITAL STRUCTURAL HEART
DISEASE

Valvular Heart Disease
These are chronic sequelae of acute Rheumatic fever or acute sequelae of infective endorcaditis
or ischaemic heart disease, consisting of valvular damage, usually left heart valves, with varied
progression of severity and complications.

Congenital Heart Disease
It is a congenital chamber defects or vessel wall anomalies

Valvular Heart Disease and Congenital structural Heart Disease may be complicated by:
     Heart failure
     Infective endocarditis

107 | P a g e
     Atrial fibrillation
     Systemic embolism eg Stroke

General measures
     Advise all patients with a heart murmur with regard to the need for prophylaxis
         treatment prior to undergoing certain medical and dental procedures
     Advise patients to inform health care providers of the presence of the heart murmur
         when reporting for medical or dental treatment

Referral
     All patients with heart murmurs for assessment
     All patients with heart murmurs not on a chronic management plan
     Development of cardiac signs and symptoms
     Worsening of clinical signs and symptoms of heart disease
     Any newly developing medical condition, e.g. fever
     All patients with valvular heart disease for advice on prophylactic antibiotic treatment
         prior to any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic process

4.0 HYPERTENSION

Hypertension is elevation of blood pressure (B.P) noted on at least three separate occasions.

Diagnosis
If blood pressure measurements performed on three separate occasions when either

    i) The initial SBP is  140mmHg or ii)The DBP is  90mmHg measured on three
              separate occasions, a minimum of 2 days apart and/or taken over period of two
              months

     a minimum of 3 blood pressure readings must be taken at the first visit to confirm
         hypertension

     If SBP is  160mmHg or DBP 100mmHg Stage II of JNC ­VII ­ especially when SBP >
         180 mmHg and/or DBP >110 mmHg Immediate drug treatment is needed - See
         Hypertensive crisis - Urgency/Emergencies section

     Consider Secondary hypertension with identifiable cause in young patients < 30 years or
         elderly patient > 60 years presenting for first time with hypertension.

KEY POINTS
     Hypertension control has shown to have significant benefit for patients.
     Co-existent risk factors should be detected and treated.
     Assess cardiovascular risk.
     Lifestyle modification and patient education are essential in all patients.
     Drug treatment for SBP >140 mmHg; DBP > 90 mmHg.
     Antihypertensive treatment is required for life in truly hypertensive patients
     Hypertension often has no symptoms: the aim of treatment is to lower the risk of End-
         organ damage, especially stroke
     Compliance is the most important determinant of blood pressure control.
     Explanation, education and minimizing side-effects of drugs are important
     Extra care should be taken with antihypertensive drugs administered to those over
         60 years of age, because of increased side-effects. Lower doses are needed
     Recommended an alternative contraceptive method for women using oestrogen

108 | P a g e
         Containing oral contraceptive
     Evidence of end organ damage, i.e. cardiomegaly, proteinuria or uraemia,

         Retinopathy or evidence of stroke, dictates immediate treatment
     Patients should be reviewed every 1-3 months, till blood pressure controlled the every

         6months and more often if necessary
     Urgent blood pressure reduction may precipitate stroke or blindness. It is only

         Indicated in those patients with hypertensive emergencies (see below)
     The aim of treatment is to bring the diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg, without unacceptable

         side effects
Note: Patients should be evaluated for Risk Stratification - Major Risk Factors, Target Organ
Damage and Associated Clinical Cardiovascular Condition and Co-morbidity

          treatment.

Resistant (Refractory) Hypertension
Hypertension that remain >140/90mmHgdespite the use of 3 antihypertensive drugs in a
rational combination at full doses and including a diuretic. Consider all correctable causes of
refractory hypertension, before you refer.

Hypertensive urgency
Symptomatic severe hypertension BP DBP >110 mmHg and/or 180mmmHg with evidence of
Target Organ Damage or grade III/IV Retinopathy with no immediate life-threatening
neurological or cardiac complication such seen in emergencies

Note; All patient hypertensive urgency should be treated in hospital

Treatment goal to lower DBP to 100mmg slowly over 48 -72 hour this can be achieved with
two oral agents preferably

     Long acting Calcium Channel Blocker
     ACE Inhibitor use in low dosage initially
     Beta Blocker
     Diuretic ­ Thiazide or Loop diuretics Furosemide beneficial in renal insufficiency &

         pulmonary oedema and potentiate above other classes

Hypertensive Emergency
A marked elevated blood pressure systolic BP  180mmHg and/or a diastolic BP
130mmHg associated with life threatening situations one or more of the following:

     Unstable angina/Myocardial Infarction

113 | P a g e
     Hypertensive Encephalopathy e.g. severe headache, visual disturbances, confusion,
         coma or seizures which may result in cerebral haemorrhage

     Acute left ventricular failure with severe pulmonary oedema (extreme breathlessnessat

5.0 HEART FAILURE

5.1 Acute Heart Failure (AHF) or Decompansated Acute Heart
Failure (DAHF)

AHF defined as rapid or gradual onset of signs & symptoms of heart failure that result on
urgent unplanned hospitalization or Emergency Medicine Department visits. The Clinical Signs &
symptoms are significantly life threatening.

If the above features occurs in patient diagnosed with structurally heart disease categerlize as
Decompansated Acute Heart Failure (DAHF).

The cause and immediate precipitating factor(s) of the AHF must be identified and treated to
prevent further damage to the heart.

Causes
     Decompensation of pre-existing chronic Heart Failure eg Cardiomyopathy, Peripartum
         Cardiomyopathy
     Acute Valvular Regurgitation ­ AR, MR 2º endocarditis, rupture of chordae tendinae
     Worsening pre-existing Valvular Disease­ MS MR AR AS
     Severe Aortic Stenosis
     Hypertensive crisis
     Acute Coronary Syndrome - NSTEMI/STEMI, RV infarction, Mechanical complication of
         ACS
     Acute arrhythmias ­ VT /VF AF/flutter or other SVTs
     Acute Severe Myocarditis
     Aortic Dissection - Acute/chronic
     Pericardial Effusion with Cardiac temponade

114 | P a g e
Precipitating factors
     Lack of Compliance with medical therapy
     Infections ­Pneumonia, UTI, septicemias
     Anaemia
     Arrhythmias ­ Rapid AF other SVTs
     Thyroid disease ­ hypothyroidism
     Pulmonary Embolus
     Volume overload - iatrogenic
      Drug abuse/Alcohol ­ eg thiamine deficiency

Treatment Goals
To improve clinical symptoms and Outcome, management strategy should be based on Clinical,
laboratory and haemodynamic findings. All patient with AHF should be cared and admitted high
care dependent unit or Intensive Care Unit

        2. Add Beta blocker ­ Carvedilolol 6.25 -25mg twice a day

      When patient is out of congestation state and SBP above 90mmHg
        3. All admitted patients with Acute heart failure should be given anticoagulation
             Unfractinated Heparin 5,000u subcutenous twice a day or
             Low molecular weight Heparin - Enoxaparine 40mg ­ 80mg subcutenous twice a day

In case patient admitted with beta blocker continue with Carvedilol unless is contraindicated

116 | P a g e
Note that
     Patients admitted with beta blocker have lower rate of ventricular arrhythmias, a shorter
         length of stay in hospital, reduced 6-month mortality compared those not receiving beta
         blocker
     Those who were maintained on them has significant lower rate of rehospitalization and
         death within 6 month after discharge

     Patient should continue their beta blocker during admission of AHF unless significant
         hypotension or cardiogenic shock present

Referral
     All patients with AHF should be treated at centre where at least can perform
         Echocardiographic assessment
     Conditions requiring Cardiac surgery refer to Muhimbili Cardiovascular Institute/Centre

5.2 Chronic Heart Failure

CHF is a clinical syndrome and has several causes.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of Chronic Heart failure requires the following features:

      Symptoms of heart failure, typically breathlessness or fatigue, at rest or during exertion
      Objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction preferably by Echocardiography (Systolic

          and/or Diastolic)
      A clinical response to treatment is supportive but not sufficient for diagnosis
Hence diagnosis and management of CHF should be sought at referral centres where at least
echocardiography assessment can be performed.

Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is considered as precursor of symptomatic HF and is

Treatment

Treatment of Systolic Heart Failure (LVEF< 45 - 50%)
Aims of Treatment

     Prevention of
         A) Disease leading to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure eg hypertension, coronary
              artery disease, valve disease etc
         B) Progression to HF once cardiac dysfunction is established

     Maintenance or Improvement in quality of life
     Improve survival

Non pharmacological management
     Patient and family education
              o Explain what HF is and why symptoms occurs, cause of HF, how to recognize
                   symptoms and what to do when they occur, daily self-weighing and what to in
                   case of weight gain.
              o Rationale of treatment, importance of adhering to drug & non drug prescription
              o Refrain from smoking

117 | P a g e
              o Prognosis
     Drug counseling ­ Effects, doses and times of administration, side effects and adverse

         effects
     Dietary and social habit ­ control sodium intake when necessary, avoid excessive fluid

         intake in severe HF Limit fluid intake to 1­1.5 L/day if fluid overloaded despite diuretic
         therapy. Avoid excessive alcohol intake
     Regular exercise within limits of symptoms.
     Sexuality counsel regarding the risk of pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives &
         Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor are not recommended in advanced HF, if used nitrate
         should be avoided < 24 -48hours of nitrate intakes
     Drug to avoid or used with caution

Pharmacological therapy
                             C: Aspirin 150 mg (O) daily
                                       Plus
                             C: Simvastatin 10 mg (O) day.

REFERRAL
     Ongoing vascular insufficiency, which may be surgically reversible

10.0 ACUTE PULMONARY EMBOLISM

Clinical Spectrum less than two weeks
     Sudden onset of dyspnoea often with unexplained anxiety (most common)
     Pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis

127 | P a g e
     Massive embolism: pleuritic chest pain, cyanosis, right heart failure and shock. Minor
         emboli or pulmonary infarction may herald massive embolism and must be treated
         vigorous

     Source of embolus may be found ­ deep vein thrombus

Investigations
     ECG ­ Not reliable test for diagnosis may be normal. Sinus tachycardia most common,
         acute right ventricular strain ­ ie right axis shift, S1Q3T3 occurs in small percentage of
         cases, may develop acute bundle branch block ­ right or left, may simulate right
         ventricular infarction, may develop arrhythmias ­ eg atrial fibrillation
     Arterial blood gases; not diagnostic, the pO2 decreased <60mmHg due
         ventilation/perfusion mismatch. pCO2 decreased due to hyperventilation, pH increased
         but may decrease in shocked patient
     D-dimer test ­ Very Sensitive blood test, but not specific. A negative test d-dimer test
         excludes an embolus in majority of cases
     Chest X-ray ­ Not very reliable usually normal, diaphgram may be raised on affected
         area, atelectasis may occur, peripheral wedge shaped shadow & plural effusion
     Cardiac Echocardiography; Useful in diagnosis, features suggestive or support
         evidence of massive embolus acute right ventricular strain
     Computered Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram Scan (CTPA); Useful can
         demonstrate the presence and extent of proximal pulmonary emboli
     Ventilation/Perfusion Scan; Useful in stable patient to confirm the diagnosis. The
         presence of a perfusion defect with normal ventilation not corresponding to an x-ray
         abnormality is characteristics
     Pulmonary Angiography: Still gold standard investigation may necessary establish
         diagnosis and catheter based embolectomy in the catheterization lab.

    Treatment
I. General

               Administer O2 ­ maintain pO2 > 60mmHg,
               Treat shock
               Correct electrolyte & acid base abnormalities and arrhythmias
               Ventilate if patient in respiratory failure

    I. Anticoagulation
                             S: Heparin (UFH) 10,000units IV bolus, then maintenance infusion starts
                             with 6,000U over 6hours to keep PTT or clotting time 2-3 times above
                             baseline. PTT should be performed 12hourly according to lab instruction.
                                       OR
                             S: Enoxaparin 1mg/kg twice daily

    Start warfarin after 24hours of heparin

    II. Thrombolytic (Fibrinolysis)
         Indicated in proximal massive pulmonary emboli & haemodynamically unstable if no
         contra-indication exists

128 | P a g e
                             S: Streptokinase 250,000IU infusion over 30minutes, then 100,000IU per
                             hour for 24hours

                                       OR
                             S: Alteplase (rtPA) 100mg IV infusion over 2hours

Referral
All cases suspected of pulmonary embolus should be referred to a specialized hospital care

11.0 CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS/ DYSRHYTHMIAS

Exclude underlying structural cardiac disease in all patients with cardiac dysrhythmias

Tachyarrythmias:

    A) Narrow QRS Complex Tachyarrythmias (SVTs)
Definition
Sustained (> 30 seconds) or non-sustained narrow QRS ( 0.1 seconds) tachycardias.

Atrial Fibrillation

Acute onset (< 48 hours)
     Assess clinically, e.g. heart failure, mitral stenosis, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, age and
         other medical conditions.
     Consider anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin
     Synchronized DC cardioversion is occasionally necessary in emergency especially
         haemodyanics instability or consider if is the first episode.

Non-acute/chronic (> 48 hours)
As above, but not immediate DC cardioversion is indiocated, unless in hypotensive emergency
case. Anticoagulation with oral warfarin 2mg ­ 5mg orally ounce a day for at least a month,
then perform elective cardioversion at specialized hospital.

Atrial Flutter
     P waves visible before QRS, commonly occurs, usually 2:1. (150 per minute). P waves,
         usually negative in Lead II precede QRS, blocked P in ST segment or hidden by QRS.
     Vagal stimulation with ECG may reveal blocked P waves.

AV Junctional Re-Entry Tachycardias
     Usually paroxysmal, Often young with normal heart.
     AV nodal re-entry or WPW syndrome. P waves usually not visible (hidden by QRS).

Atrial Tachycardias
     Rare, Often incessant P before QRS (often long PR) or hidden in T
     May cause heart failure (tachycardia cardiomyopathy).

129 | P a g e
Atrial Fibrillation

Pharmacological Treatment
Initial

     Anticoagulate with warfarin.
     Control the ventricular rate with one of the following:

                   C: Digoxin oral, 0.25mg daily; use only in heart failure.

                   A: Atenolol, oral, 50­100 mg daily (contraindicated in asthmatics; caution in
                   Heart failure).
     DC cardioversion in selected cases, after 4 weeks Warfarin anticoagulation.

Long ­ term
     Continue Warfarin anticoagulation long-term, unless contra-indicated: Warfarin, oral, 5
         mg daily.
          Control with INR to therapeutic range: INR between 2­3: patient is stable do 3
         monthly monitoring
          If INR < 1.5 or > 3.5: do monthly monitoring

Use:
     Prophylaxis in chronic atrial fibrillation
     Prior to cardioversion to sinus rhythm
     In lone atrial fibrillation of persons 65 or older.

If the patient has a prosthetic valve, ADD
                   C: Aspirin, soluble, oral, 150 mg daily

CAUTION
Use Warfarin only if INR can be monitored regularly.If not, consider use of aspirin.

Rate control
Continue as above.
Digoxin only controls rate at rest and is insufficient on its own.
If used long-term, combine with s-blocker.
In the elderly and patients with renal impairment:

                   C: Digoxin (O) 0.125 mg initial dose
           Adjust dosages according to trough levels within the therapeutic range.
           Do levels only if the patient has been on the drug for at least 10 days.

                   A: Atenolol (O) 50­100 mg daily

Prevention of recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
Only in patients with severe symptoms despite the above measures:

                   D: Amiodarone 200 mg (O) 8 hourly for 1 week, followed 200 mg twice daily for
                   one week and thereafter 200 mg daily. Specialist initiated.
Precautions:
     halve dosage of warfarin and monitor INR closely, until stable
     avoid concomitant digoxin
     monitor thyroid function every 6­12 months as thyroid abnormalities may develop

130 | P a g e
Atrial Flutter

Non pharmacological Treatment ­ Electrical Cardioversion
Synchronised DC cardioversion, 200 J, after sedation with:

                   A: Diazepam 10­20 mg IV
If flutter has been present longer than 48 hours, defer cardioversion for 4 weeks after
anticoagulation with warfarin, unless severe symptoms or heart failure require urgent
conversion.

Pharmacological Treatment
None is nearly as effective as DC cardioversion.
Most drugs have serious side effects. Do not use verapamil as it will not convert flutter
to sinus rhythm and may cause serious hypotension.
Anticoagulants if sustained.

Long term treatment: Recurrent atrial flutter is an indication for referral. Many can be cured
by radiofrequency catheter ablation.

AV Junctional Re-Entry Tachycardias

Non Pharmacological Treatment
Vagal manoeuvres: Valsalva or carotid sinus massage. The patient should be supine and as
relaxed as possible, to avoid competing sympathetic reflexes.

Pharmacological Treatment
If vagal manoeuvres fail:

                   D: Adenosine, rapid IV bolus, 6 mg through a good IV line, followed by a bolus
                   of 10 mL Sodium chloride 0.9% to ensure that it reaches the heart before it is
                   broken down.

           Run the ECG for 1 minute after the injection.
           If 6 mg fails, repeat with 12 mg.
           If the drug reaches the central circulation before it is broken down the patient will
experience flushing, sometimes chest pain and anxiety. If the tachycardia fails to terminate
without these symptoms, the drug did not reach the heart.
If none of the above is effective, or if the patient is hypotensive, consider DC shock.

         CAUTION Verapamil and digoxin are contraindicated in WPW syndrome.

Long ­ term Treatment
Teach the patient to perform vagal manoeuvres, Valsalva is the most effective.
For infrequent, non-incapacitating symptoms:
ß ­Blockers e.g.:

                   A: Atenolol 50­100 mg (O) daily (If asthmatic)
                                       OR

                   D: Verapamil (O) 80­120 mg three times daily (Normal heart)

131 | P a g e
Referral
NARROW QRS COMPLEX (SUPRAVENTRICULAR) TACHYARRYTHMIAS (SVTs)

     Poor rate control
     Severe persistent symptoms
     Patients with severe symptoms

REGULAR NARROW QRS (SUPRAVENTRICULAR) TACHYCARDIAS
     Frequent or severe symptoms for curative radiofrequency catheter ablation
     all WPW syndrome (sinus rhythm ECG shows delta waves) for radiofrequency catheter
         ablation

    B) WIDE QRS (VENTRICULAR) TACHYARRHYTHMIAS (VTs)
Definition
Sustained (> 30 seconds) or non-sustained wide QRS (> 0.12 seconds) tachycardias

A REGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS
         Are ventricular until proved otherwise.
        Regular wide QRS supraventricular tachycardias are uncommon.

B SUSTAINED (> 30 SEC) IRREGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS
       Are usually due to atrial fibrillation with bundle branch block, or pre-excitation
        (WPW syndrome).

C NON-SUSTAINED (< 30 SEC) IRREGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS
        Are usually ventricular.
        They are common in acute myocardial infarction.

D TORSADES DE POINTES VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (VT)
Has a twisting pattern to the QRS complexes and a prolonged QT interval

        in sinus rhythm.
        It is usually due to a QT-prolonging drug, ± hypokalaemia.

(A) REGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS
     Refer all cases after resuscitation and stabilisation.
     Emergency DC cardioversion is mandatory with a full protocol of CPR.

Non Pharmacological Treatment
     Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

If no cardiac arrest:
     DC cardioversion, 200 J, after sedation with:
         Diazepam, I.V, 10­20 mg
           If 200 J fails, use 360 J.

If cardiac arrest:
     Defibrillate (not synchronised).

Pharmacological Treatment
DC cardioversion is first line therapy for regular wide QRS tachycardias. Drugs are needed if VT
recurs after cardioversion or if spontaneous termination/recurrence.

132 | P a g e
                   D: Amiodarone, IV, 5 mg/kg infused over 30 minutes
                                       Plus

                   D: Amiodarone 800 mg (O) once daily for 7 days then 600 mg/day for 3 days
                   followed by a maintenance dose of 200­400 mg/day

CAUTION Amiodarone may cause a serious long-term side effects and long half-life.
Therefore, patients require regular monitoring by specialist.

                   D: Lidocaine 50­100 mg (1­2 mg/kg) IV initially and at 5 minute intervals if
                   required to a total of 200­300 mg,
                   Thereafter, for recurrent ventricular tachycardia only
                   D: Lidocaine, IV infusion, 1­3 mg/minute for 24­30 hours. Lidocaine will only
                   terminate ± 30% of sustained ventricular tachycardias, and may cause
                   hypotension, heart block or convulsions.

CAUTION Never give verapamil IV to patients with a wide QRS tachycardia.

Note: For emergency treatment of ventricular tachycardia, DC cardioversion is first-line
therapy, even if stable

(B) SUSTAINED (> 30 SECONDS) IRREGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS
If the QRS complexes have a pattern of typical right or left bundle branch block, with
a rate < less than 170/minute, treat as for atrial fibrillation. See Section for Atrial fibrillation.
If the rate is > 170 per minute, and/or the complexes are atypical or variable, the likely
diagnosis is WPW syndrome with atrial fibrillation, conducting via the bypass tract, DC
conversion.

Do not treat with drugs
Verapamil and digoxin may precipitate ventricular fibrillation by increasing the ventricular rate.

(C) NON-SUSTAINED (< 30 SECONDS) IRREGULAR WIDE QRS TACHYCARDIAS
Most are ventricular.
In acute myocardial infarction, only treat non-sustained ventricular tachycardia if it causes
significant haemodynamic compromise. Ensure the serum potassium level is above 4 mmol/L

Pharmacological Treatment
                   D: Amiodarone, IV, 5 mg/kg infused over 30 minutes. Specialist initiated.
                                       Plus
                   D: Amiodarone 800 mg (O) once daily for 7 days then 600 mg/day for 3 days
                   followed by a maintenance dose of 200­400 mg/day
                                       OR

Only in a haemodynamically stable patient:
                   D: Lidocaine, IV, 50­100 mg (1­2 mg/kg) initially and at 5 minute intervals if
                   required to a total of 200­300 mg.

          Thereafter, for recurrent ventricular tachycardia only:
                   D: Lidocaine, IV infusion, 1­3 mg/minute for 24­30 hours

133 | P a g e
In the absence of acute ischaemia or infarction, consider torsades de pointes, due to
QT prolonging drugs.

(D)  TORSADES DE POINTES VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (VT)

Non Pharmacological Treatment

 Cardioversion/defibrillation, as necessary.

     Torsades complicating bradycardia: temporary pacing.

Pharmacological Treatment
Stop all QT-prolonging drugs.
Correct serum potassium.

                   B: Magnesium sulphate 2 g I.V over 5­10 minutes

If recurrent episodes after initial dose of magnesium sulphate:

                B: Magnesium sulphate 2 g I.V over 24 hours
Torsades complicating bradycardia:

              A: Adrenaline infusion to raise heart rate to > 100 per minute (if temporary
     pacing unavailable).

Referral
All cases of wide QRS tachycardia, after resuscitation and stabilisation

12.0 HEART BLOCK (SECOND OR THIRD DEGREE)

The majority of cases occurs in patients over 60 years and is idiopathic, with an excellent long-
term prognosis, provided a permanent pacemaker is implanted. Acute, reversible AV block
commonly complicates inferior myocardial infarction. The condition may also be induced by
metabolic and electrolyte disturbances, as well as by certain medicines.

Non Pharmacological Treatment
     Emergency cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.
     External pacemaker should be available in all secondary hospitals and must be preceded
         by appropriate analgesia.

Pharmacological Treatment
Analgesia if external pacemaker:

                   C: Morphine 10­15 mg IM 3­6 hourly

AV nodal block with narrow QRS complex escape rhythm only:
                   B: Atropine, I.V bolus, 0.6­1.2 mg, May be repeated until a pacemaker is
                   inserted.

Use in a patient with inferior myocardial infarct and hypotension and second degree
AV block. It is temporary treatment of complete AV block before referral (urgently) for
pacemaker.

134 | P a g e
                                       OR
For resuscitation of asystole:

                   A: Adrenaline 1:10 000, slow IV, 5 mL (0.5 mg)
Used as temporary treatment of complete heart block when other drugs are not effective

Referral

               CAUTION HEART BLOCK IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.
                                       REFER URGENTLY!

 All cases with a heart rate below 40 beats/minute after resuscitation and stabilisation
 All cases of second or third degree AV block, whether or not myocardial infarct or other

    reversible cause is suspected, and whether or not the patient is thought to be
    symptomatic
 A permanent pacemaker is the definitive form of treatment. This service is only available
    in Muhimbili Cardiovascular Institute (tertiary institutions) for now.

13.0 SINUS BRADYCARDIA & SINUS ARREST

This rhythm does not require treatment, unless they are causing symptoms, i.e. syncope,
dizziness, tiredness and poor effort tolerance.

Sinus bradycardia < 50/minute or sinus arrest with slow escape rhythm, accompanied by
hypotension, strongly suggests a treatable underlying cause:

     Acute inferior myocardial infarct
     Hyperkalaemia, especially if wide QRS and/or peaked T waves
     Drugs, especially combination of verapamil and ß ­blocker or digoxin
     Hypothermia
     Hypoxia
Treat the cause. Consider atropine if inferior infarct.

SINUS ARREST
     Refer all to a cardiologist specialists.

SKIN DISEASES AND ALLERGIC REACTIONS

1.0 BACTERIAL SKIN INFECTION

Bacterial skin infections can range from impetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, erysipelas, cellulitis to
recurrent boils. All these are caused by either staphylococcus alone or together with
streptococcus but rarely streptococcus alone. There are other non-bacterial skin infections
i.e.viral (warts, herpes simplex, herpes zoster and varicella, kaposis varicelliform eruption),
fungal (candidiasis, tinea corporis, pityriasis versicolor), skin infestations (scabies and
pediculosis)

1.1 Impetigo

It is bacterial infection of subcorneal layer of epidermis with characteristic honey-colored serous
crusts. It is usually caused by a staphylococcus aureus. It occurs commonly in school children,
usually starting on the face, especially around the mouth or nose. May form bullous lesions
(bullous impetigo) characteristically flaccid.

Treatment Options
     Remove crusts
     Wet dressings: weak PP soaks, 1:40000 (0.025%) solution 0.5% GV paint
     Apply Topical mupirocin 2% b.d for 5 to 7days OR Topical fusidine b.d for 5 to 7days
     Simply wash with soap and water
     Keep infected areas clean and prevent spread to others [ care with towels, clothes,
         beddings; change frequently)
     If severe, or systematic symptoms are present (e.g. Pyrexia) add an oral antibiotic.
         Drug of Choice is

               A: Phenoxymethylpenicillin (O)for 7-10 days

Adults         250 ­ 500mg every six hours
Children       25mg/kg/24 hrs every six hours

Second Choice

               A: Erythromycin (O) for 7-10 days

Adult          250 ­ 500mg every 6 hours

Children       25-50mg/kg/24 hrs in 4 divided doses

               OR

               A: Cloxacillin (O) for 7 ­ 10 days

Adults         250 ­ 500mg four times daily (every 6 hours)

Children       50 ­ 100 mg/kg/24hrs every 6hours in equal doses

136 | P a g e
1.2 Folliculitis

It is the inflammation of the hair follicle. The most common forms are caused by invasive
staphylococcus but other bacteria, viruses, and fungi may also be responsible. Other forms
(eosinophilic folliculitis in HIV/AIDS) are non infectious. Mechanical irritation is also a factor,
such as prolonged sitting. Deep follicular inflammation often occurs in the bearded areas of the
face (Sycosis barbae).

Treatment
     Suspected irritants should be avoided
     Use of suitable disinfecting and cleansing agents should be encouraged
     Appropriate anti-infective skin preparations (Neomycin sulphate, gentamycin
         oxytetracycline cream/ointment or mupirocin ointment 2% can be used
     If severe, or systematic symptoms are present (e.g. Pyrexia) add an oral antibiotic or
         systemic antibiotics (penicillinase-resistant penicillins or first-generation cephalosporins
         for 7­10days).

1.3 Furunculosis

It is deep follicular infection that starts as a firm red nodule which rapidly becomes painful and
fluctuant in a few days. Healing with scarring it follows over several weeks. In some individuals
it is chronic and recurrent.

Treatment
     Usually resolves spontaneously, but is improved by placing hot compresses over the boil
         until it breaks
     In a healthy person, review after 2 days, if not improving consider surgical incision and
         drainage

Note: If the boil causes swollen lymph nodes and fever, consider systemic antibiotics

Drugs of Choice
Adults

                   C: Flucloxacillin (O) 500mg four times daily for 7 -10 days;
                                       OR

                   A: Erythromycin (0) 500mg 8hrly for 7-10days;
Children

                   C: Flucloxacillin (O) 50-100mg/24hrs every 6hours in equal doses
                                       OR

                   A: Erythromycin (0) 25-50mg/kg/every 8 hours in a day.

For recurrent furuncles (furunculosis):Give systemic antibiotics (often clindamycin 300mg B.D.
for 7­10days), search for predisposing factors (diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, perineal
or nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus

137 | P a g e
1.4 Erysipelas

It is bacterial infection of upper half of dermis with lymphatic vessel involvement, due to
streptococcal infection Group A B Hemolytic Strep (Group C, G and B). The disease begins as a
small break in the skin or umbilical stump (infants). The affected area has growing redness,
accompanied by high fever and pains.

Treatment
     Bed rest
     Lifting the affected part

                   A: Potassium permanganate solution 1:4000
                                                 OR

                   C: Mupirocin ointment 2% application may be beneficial

                                                 Plus
                   A: Phenoxymethylpenicillin or Amoxicillin (O) 500mg 6hrly for 7-10 days

         Children
                   A:Phenoxymethylpenicillin or Amoxicillin (O)25-50mg/kg 6hrlyfor 7-10 days

Note: Erysipelas has a tendency to recur in the same area, especially if there are predisposing
factors such as chronic lymphatic oedema. In recurrent episodes, increase the duration of
antibiotics to 10 ­ 14 days

1.5 Acute Cellulitis

It is a deep inflammation involving lower half of dermis and subcutaneus tissue most commonly
caused by streptococci or staphylococci. Acute cellulitis should be differentiated from erysipelas

1.6 Acne

It is a multifactorial disease primarily of teenagers with follicular plugging and inflammation.
Polymorphic lesions include open and closed comedones, papules, pustules nodular and cystic
lesions involving the face, chest, shoulders and back.

Treatment
     Seek underlying cause e.g. stress, overuse of ointments on skin, steroids or
         anticonvulsant drugs etc.
     Encourage a healthy lifestyle ­ exercise, sunshine, diet, etc
     Use ordinary soap (harsh antibacterial cleansers or iodine-containing preparations may
         aggravate the acne)

         Treatment of choice:
                   A:Benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel topically at night for 3-6 months
                                       Plus

         further assessment.
Note: The acne may initially worsen with treatment. If too irritant, use every second or third
night. Patients should be encouraged to persist with treatment.

1.7 Paronychia

It is inflammation of the nail fold characterized by painful red swellings of the nail folds which
may be due to bacteria or yeast.

Acute Paronychia
Treatment

2.0 FUNGAL SKIN INFECTIONS

2.1 Dermatophytosis (Ringworm)

It is a chronic fungal infection determined by the nature of the dermatophyte, by the tissue it
invades i.e. skin, hair or nails and by the degree of host response. Infections with
dermatophytes are usually called tinea; for further description, the anatomical site is added.
The clinical infection usually starts from an innoculation site and spreads peripherally hence the
annular lesions with an active border. In non medical jargon, the diagnosis is often known as
"ringworm". It is sometimes accompanied by loss of hair, itching and pustules.

2.1.1Tinea Corporis (Body Ringworm)
Annular, expanding lesions with central healing and distinct borders on the body or face. A fine
scale may be present.

Treatment
Drug of choice

                   A: Compound benzoic acid (Whitfield's ointment) applied two times a day for up
                   to 4 weeks.
Second choice
                   A: Clotrimazole cream1% applies thinly two times a day, continue for 5 to 7 days
after clearing of lesions

                                                 OR
                   C:Miconazole cream 2%, and apply thinly two times a day. Continue for 5-7
days after clearing of lesions.

2.1.2 Tinea Capitis (Scalp Ringworm)
In this case, the fungus has affected the hair follicle. Topical treatment is not effective. Treat
with:

                   B: Griseofulvin (O) 500mg daily for 6 week, together with fatty meals
                   Children 15-20mg/kg once daily

                 Note: Do not crush the tablet (micronised tablet)

2.2 Pityriasis Versicolor

Common fungal infection caused by yeast. Hypopigmented/hyperpigmented confluent patches
of varying size with fine scale on the chest, back, arms and occasionally neck and face.

Treatment
     Apply whitfield ointment, miconazole or clotrimazole cream into scales twice daily for 2
         weeks

                                       OR
                   C: Sodium thiosulphate solution 20% twice daily for 2weeks
     Oral ketoconazole may be used in more widespread lesions, 200mg once a day for 2
         weeks.

140 | P a g e
2.3 Tinea Pedis (Athlete's Foot)

This is a very common fungal infection and is often the source of infection at other sites. Treat
any bacterial superinfection first:
First choice:

                   A: Whitefield's lotion twice daily for 2 weeks
Second choice: If fails to respond, try

                   A: Clotrimazole cream 1% twice daily for 2 weeks.
                             OR

                   C: Miconazole cream 2%
                             OR

                   C: Tolnaftate solution twice daily

In severe infections use
                   D: Terbinafin 250mg once or twice for 2 weeks to 1 month.

ADVISE: Frequent change of socks/footwear, use of cotton socks, thorough drying between
toes after bathing, separating the opposing skin surfaces (e.g. with a piece of gauze) will help
speed up healing

2.4 Candidiasis

It is caused mainly by candida albicans. Clinical features depend on the site of infection. The
skin lesions are characterized by an erythematous, moist exudate in the skin folds. Patients may
develop subcorneal and satellite pustules.
Involvement of the nails lead to painful swelling of the nail bed and folds which may discharge
pus and is made worse by contact with water. There may be destruction of the nail plate.
Oral lesions are characterized by white, adherent mucosal plaques in buccal cavity including
tongue which may be forcibly removed. May extend to oesophagus and lower GIT.
Vulval-vaginal candidiasis is characterized by itchy, curd-like whitish vaginal discharge, dysuria
and dyspareunia.
Candidiasis is usually precipitated by prolonged use of contraceptive pills, pregnancy, diabetes,
prolonged antibiotic and corticosteroid use ANDimmunosuppressive treatment.

2.5 Deep fungal infections

The common clinical entities of deep fungal infecitons are Nocardiosis and Madura foot which
may be a Mycetoma or and actinomycetoma. Mycetoma is caused by madurella mycetomatis
and Actinomycosis by actinomyces. The clinical features depend on the infected site and can
last months to years.

     First lesion: nodule
     Localisation: feet, legs, arms, buttocks, scalp, trunk
     Discharging sinuses: Grains may be visible usually black for Eumycetomas and white

         yellow for Actinomycetomas. Patients usually experience pain before rupture of
         discharging sinus.

3.0 PARASITE INFECTION

Scabies
Scabies is an intensely pruritic and highly contagious infestation of the skin caused by a mite
Sarcoptes scabie burrowing into the skin; affecting humans and other animals.The main clinical
features are, a short elevated serpiginous (S-shaped) track in the superficial epidermis, known
as a burrow, this is pathognomonic of a scabies infestation. A small vesicle or papule may
appear at the end of the burrow or occur independently. Norwegian scabies presents with
extensive crusting (psoriasiformlike lesions) of the skin with thick, hyperkeratotic scales
overlying the elbows, knees, palms, and soles.

Treatment
                   A: Benzoyl Benzoate Emulsion 25% (12.5% for children) apply every 12 hours
                   for 3 days. Repeat treatment after 1 week.

         Note
     Treat all close contacts, especially children in the same household with
     Wash clothes and beddings, leave in the sun to dry followed by ironing.
     Secondary bacterial infection, (septic scores") treat with antibiotics as in impetigo for 5

         days.
     Explain that the itch may continue for several weeks after treatment. In case of itching

         apply steroid

4.0 VIRAL INFECTION

4.1Herpes Simplex

It is anacute viral infection characterized by superficial vesicles containing clear fluid in the skin
and mucous membranes, particularly of the buccal area, on the conjunctiva, corneas or
genitalia. It is caused by the herpes virus homines. The main clinical features are: prodromal
symptoms of tingling discomfort or itching, followed by vesicular formation.

Treatment
                   B: Acyclovir (O) 400mg 8 hourly for 7 ­ 10 days

Note: Use of systemic Acyclovir is optimum when given within the first 48

4.2 Herpes Zoster (Shingles)

It is due to the resurgence of the varicella-zoster virus which also causes chickenpox. Severe
burning pain precedes the appearance of grouped vesicles overlying erythematous skin and
following a dermatome; does not cross the midline. The disease may heal with scarring.

Treatment

               A: Acyclovir cream 5% applied until vesicles desapear.
                                  Plus

                   C: Mupirocin 2% cream

Post-Herpetic Neuralgia
After the lesions have resolved:

                   C: Amitriptyline (O)25 mg at night, may be increased to 150 mg at night
                                       OR

                   C: Carbamazepine (O) 100 mg at night; may be gradually increased to twice a
        day according to response.

CAUTION: Refer if there is no improvement of severe neuralgia. Refer immediately in case
of herpes zoster ophthalmicus for atropinization

4.3 Chicken Pox

Chicken pox like herpes zoster is caused by the varicella zoster virus. Lesions are preceded by
fever and characteristically vesicular in different stages of development. It is self limiting.

Treatment complications
Adult

                   A: Paracetamol 1 g every 8 hours

                   A: Calamine lotion with 1% phenolas in adults

5.0 ALLERGIC CONDITIONS

5.1Allergic Contact Dermatitis

It is a delayed hypersensitivity following skin contact with a particular chemical (dye, perfume,
rubber, nickel or drugs, skin preparations containing lanolin, iodine, antihistamines, neomycin,
vioform etc).

Management
Avoid contact if allergic.

5.2 Eczema

Atopic Dermatitis/Eczema: Often a personal or family history of atopic disease (asthma,
hay fever or atopic dermatitis). Exact cause is not known. These persons are also more
susceptible to herpes simplex and vaccinia (but not varicella-zoster).
The clinical form may differ according to age

144 | P a g e
I. Infantile eczema ("milk crust"): usually appears at 3 months of age with oozing and
crusting affecting the cheeks, forehead and scalp.

IMPORTANT:If generalized exfoliative dermatitis develops, refer to a specialist

II.Flexural eczema: starts at 3-4 years, affecting the flexure surface of elbows, knees and
nape of neck (thickening and lichenificaiton). In adults any part of the body may be affected
with intense itching, particularly at night.

Note: Eczema may evolve through acute (weepy), subacute (crusted lesions), and chronic
(lichenified, scaly) forms.

Treatment of Eczema
     Remove any obvious cause e.g. skin irritants or allergens (avoid irritants e.g. medicated
         soap, wool and extremes of temperature).
                   D:Apply Emulsifying ointment - the equivalent of cream E45, Sofderm cream
     Treat itching with an oral antihistamine:
                   A: Chlorpheniramine (O) 4-16 mg at night
                                       OR
                   A: Promethazine (O)25mg at bedtime increased to 50mg if necessary
                                       OR
                   C: Cetrizine 10mg
                                       OR
                   C: Loratadine 10mg once daily

CAUTION:Never use topical antihistamines

     Treat any infection (usually bacterial, but occasionally viral). Choice of skin preparations
         depends on whether lesions are wet (exudative) or dry/lichenified (thickened skin with
         increased skin markings).

     If eczema is "weepy", use saline baths or bathe in:
                   A:Potassium permanganate 1:4000 (0.025%) solution once daily for 2-4 days

         until dry. Where large areas are involved give a course of antibiotics for 5-10 days (as
         for impetigo)

     After the lesions have dried, apply an aqueous cream for a soothing effect. A topical
         corticosteroid cream may be useful in the acute phase. Use the mildest topical
         corticosteroid which is effective, start with:
                   C: Hydrocortisone 1% cream for wet, ointment for dry skin. Apply thinly, initially,
         two times a day.

CAUTION: Only use 1% hydrocortisone on the face unless prescribed by a specialist

Note: Potent topical corticosteroids may cause harmful cutaneous and systemic side effects
especially if use is prolonged or involves extensive body surface. Striae, acne,
hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, hirsutism and atrophy may result. Avoid long term
use; don't use on weepy or infected skin. Advise patients NOT to use them as cosmetics

145 | P a g e
     If the skin starts scaling (condition becomes chronic), add/apply an emollient such as:
         emulsifying ointment or liquid paraffin.

5.3 Urticaria

It may be allergic, toxic or physical in origin. In many cases the cause is unknown (idiopathic).
Allergic urticaria may be caused by: drugs (e.g. penicillin), infection, contact with plants, pollen,
insect bites, or foodstuff (e.g. fish, eggs, citrus fruits, nuts, strawberries, tomatoes). Physical
urticaria may be caused by mechanical irritation, cold, heat, sweating.

Treatment
     If acute (existing for less than 3 months), exclude drug reactions (e.g. penicillin), or
         infection
     Give oral antihistamines:
                   A: Chlorpheniramine (O)4-16 mg once at night
                                       OR
                   A: Promethazine (O) if sleeplessness is a feature: Adults, 25 -50 mg at night
                                       OR
                   C: Cetrizine (O) 10mg once daily
                                       OR
                   C: Loratadine (O) 10mg once daily
                   Children0.1 ­ 0.2 mg/kg 2-4 times a day or 0.5 mg/kg at bedtime
     Deworm patients with Albendazole (0) 400mg stat in adults.

Note: Warn about drowsiness. If no improvement after 1 month or chronic problem, refer to
specialist for combination therapy (H1, H2 inhibitors).

5.4 Psoriasis

An inherited inflammatory condition of the skin characterized by thick, silvery white scaly
plaques affecting mainly scalp and extensor body surfaces usually symmetrically distributed
with a chronic relapsing course.
Note: Exclude precipitating factors e.g. alcohol, deficiencies of B12 or folate, stress, infections.

Treatment
     Sun exposure to the lesions for half an hour or one hour daily may be of benefit
                   C:Crude Coal tar 5% in Vaseline in the morning
                                       Plus

147 | P a g e
Children 5-12 years
                   A: Co-trimoxazole 480 mg every 12 hours for 4 weeks
                                       Plus
                   S: Streptomycin 20- 40 mg/kg body weight for 10 days

CAUTION: Doxycycline should not be used in children under 12 years or during pregnancy

6.4 Lichen Planus

It is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, extremely pruritic. Primary lesions are characterized
by violaceous, shiny flat topped papules which may coalesce and evolve into into scaly plaques
distributed over inner wrists, arms and thighs as well as sacral area. Post inflammatory hyper
pigmentation is common. Scarring alopecia may result from lichen planopilaris (severe)

Treatment
                   A: Chlorpheniramine (O) 4mg 6 hourly
                                       Plus
                   A:Betamethasone valerate ointment 0.1% twice daily
                                       Plus
                   D: Clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05% -0.1% twice daily

         In severe case refer to specialist for systemic corticosteroid and topical application
         under occlusion

6.5 Drug Reactions

Drug reactions can be classified in many ways. One useful approach is to separate
predictable reactions occurring in normal patients from unpredictablereactions occurring in
susceptible patients.

Predictable adverse reactions
     Overdosage (wrong dosage or defect in drug metabolism)
     Side effects (sleepiness from antihistamines)
     Indirect effects (antibiotics change normal flora)
     Drug interactions (alter metabolism of drugs; most commonly the cytochromeP-450
         system)

Unpredictable adverse reactions
     Allergic reaction (drug allergy or hypersensitivity; immunologic reaction to drug; requires
         previous exposure or cross-reaction).
     Pseudoallergic reaction (nonimmunologic activation of mast cells).
     Idiosyncratic reaction (unexplained reaction, not related to mechanism of action, without
         known or suspected immunologic mechanism).

_
Note:

     Although we will concentrate on cutaneous drug reactions, remember that every organ
         system can be affected.

148 | P a g e
     Almost every drug can cause almost every type of reaction. Clinically, one must learn
         which reactions are most likely to produce certain findings.

     80% of allergic and pseudoallergic drug reactions are caused by  -lactam antibiotics,
         aspirin, NSAIDs, and sulfonamides

Types of Drug Reactions
The most common types of drug reactions are macular and maculopapular exanthems along
with urticaria and angioedema; Fixed drug eruption and erythema multiforme/toxic epidermal
necrolysis

              I. Exanthemous Reaction
. Main differential diagnostic consideration is viral exanthem or on occasion acute exanthem
such as guttae psoriasis or pityriasis rosea.

Drugs commonly responsible: Ampicillin, amoxicillin, aminoglycosides, allopurinol, barbiturates,
benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, co-trimoxazole, gold salts, penicillin, phenytoin, piroxicam

              II. Fixed drug Eruption.
It is a cutaneous drug reaction that recurs at exactly the same site with repeated exposure to
the agent.Clinical features include typically red-brown patch or plaque; occasionally may be
bullous. Most common sites are genitalia, palms, and soles, as well as mucosa. Lesions typically
5­10cm in diameter but can be larger; often multiple. It starts as edematous papule or plaque;
later becomes darker. Frequently resolves with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. It is
uncommon in children.
_
Note: When confronted with hyperpigmented macule on genitalia, always think of fixed drug
eruption
Management: Avoidance of triggering agent; topical corticosteroids may speed resolution

              III. Severe Skin Reactions
    a. Erythema multiforme
Most erythema multiforme is caused by herpes simplex virus, especially if recurrent. The
classical clinical findings are iris or target lesions, most often on the distal limbs. Lesions caused
by mycoplasma or especially drugs are moreoften on the trunk and less like to have a target
pattern. We prefer the term erythema multiforme­like for such lesions, which carry the risk of
developing into severe skin reactions.

    b. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)
It is a combination of erythema multiforme with mucosal lesions as well as systemic signs and
symptoms whereby more than 90% of the skin area is involved

Clinical features:
     Patients almost invariably have prodrome with fever, malaise, or arthralgias.
     Abrupt development of erythema multiforme
     Mucosal involvement

149 | P a g e
     Mouth (100%): Erosions, hemorrhage and crusts on lips, and erosions in
     Mouth covered by necrotic white pseudomembrane.
     Eyes (70­90%): Erosive conjunctivitis, can lead to scarring.
     Genitalia (60­70%): Painful erosions.
     When mycoplasma is trigger, pulmonary involvement is possible (20%).

Management
     Short burst of systemic corticosteroids helpful in many cases but two problems:
     Exclude or treat underlying infection, which could beworsened by immunosuppression..
     Routine topical care: disinfectant mouth washes, antibiotic or corticosteroid eye drops
         (after ophthalmologic consultation).

    c. Toxic epidermal necrolysis
It is a severe life-threatening disorder with generalized loss of epidermis and mucosa

Clinical features:
     Prodrome depends on underlying disease and triggering drug
     Sudden onset of either diffuse maculae (erythema multiforme­like drug reaction) or
         diffuse erythema without maculae
     Then prompt progression towards widespread erythema and peeling of skin; skin lies in
         sheets and folds on the bedding.
     Extensive mucosal erosions.
     Possible loss of hair and nails, as well as extensive postinflammatory hypopigmentation.
     Multiple systemic programs because of fluid and protein loss, difficulties in temperature
         regulation, fever, leukocytosis, and risk of secondary infections.

Treatment
 Systemic corticosteroids, if employed, should be used early to attempt to abort the

immunologic reaction. Later in the course, they probably increase risk of infection and
slowhealing.

                   A: Prednisolone 80­120mg daily.

Note: Ophthalmologic monitoring is essential, as risk of scarring and blindness is significant

    d. Pruritic papula eruptions (PPE)
This is a skin condition characterized by itchy popular eruptions on the extensor area of the
upper and lower limbs which is associated with HIV infection.

Treatment

               C: Betamethasone valerate 0.025% 12 hourly for 3-4 weeks
                                  OR

               S: Dapsone 100mg once a day for one months

6.6 Albinism

Definition
Albinism is an inherited condition present at birth, characterized by a lack of pigment that
normally gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Many types of albinism exist, all of which
involve lack of pigment in varying degrees. The condition, which is found in all races, may be
accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skin cancer later in life if not well prevented at
elarly childhood.

Diagnosis
It's not always easy to diagnose the exact type of albinism a person has; there are two tests
available that can identify only two types of the condition. Recently, a blood test has been
developed that can identify carriers of the gene for some types of albinism; a similar test during
amniocentesis can diagnose some types of albinism in an unborn child. A chorionic villus
sampling test during the fifth week of pregnancy may also reveal some types of albinism.

The specific type of albinism a person has can be determined by taking a good family history
and examining the patient and several close relatives.

The "hairbulb pigmentation test" is used to identify carriers by incubating a piece of the
person's hair in a solution of tyrosine, a substance in food which the body uses to make
melanin. If the hair turns dark, it means the hair is making melanin (a "positive" test); light hair
means there is no melanin. This test is the source of the names of two types of albinism: "ty-
pos" and "ty-neg."

The tyrosinase test is more precise than the hairbulb pigmentation test. It measures the rate at
which hair converts tyrosine into another chemical (DOPA), which is then made into pigment.
The hair converts tyrosine with the help of a substance called "tyrosinase." In some types of
albinism, tyrosinase is not active and hence melanin production breaks down.

Prevention
-Genetic counseling is very important to prevent further occurrences of the condition.

-Mechanical preventions such as long slive shirt, bouze , skirt and trousers and wide briam hat
to prevente skin cancers

Adults and Children

                   C: SPF 30+(Contains-Titanium Dioxide 9% , Zinc Oxide 8%)

                             Apply twice a day at 8am and 2pm Daily.

151 | P a g e
Treatment
There is no treatment that can replace the lack of melanin that causes the symptoms of
albinism. For the eye problems that often accompany the lack of skin color, glasses which are
tinted should be worn to ease pain from too much sunlight.
There is no cure for involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and treatments for focusing
problems (surgery or contact lenses) are not effective in all cases.
Senile Pruritus
Itching associated with degenerative changes that occur in aging skin.
Treatment
Skin lubrication twice daily with Glycerin

Osteomyelitis denotes infection of the bone and is most common in children under 12 years.
Staphylococci are the most frequent responsible organisms. Salmonella osteomyelitis infection
is a common complication of sickle cell anaemia. Tuberculous osteomyelitis occurs in
association with having tuberculosis

Diagnosis
     Common symptoms are fever, malaise and severe pain at the site of bone infection
     If the infection is close to a joint there may be a `sympathetic' effusion

                   orally 4 weeks

Further treatment should be influenced by results of culture and sensitivity.

In case of salmonella being identified then give:
                   B: Chloramphenicol 500 mg IV every 6 hours for at least 21 days
                                       Plus
                   A: Benzyl Penicillin1.2 MU IV or IM every 6 hours for at least 21 days

Children

               A:Paracetamol 10mg/kg body weight every 8 hours.

1.2 Tropical Pyomyositis

The cause of tropical pyomyositis is uncertain since abscesses explored early are sterile but
later culture of the pus usually yields Staphylococcus aureus.

Diagnosis
The main clinical features are fever and painful induration of one or more of the large muscles,
mostly in the lower limbs

154 | P a g e
Treatment
     Drain the pus from abscess
         Adults:

                   A: Erythromycin 10 mg/kg body weight every 6 hours for 14 days

2.0 INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS

General Guidelines
          The first line treatment for most of these conditions is a non-steroidal anti-
              inflammatory drug (NSAID). This group includes Aspirin, Indomethacin and
              Ibuprofen, but does NOT include Paracetamol
          NSAIDs should be used cautiously in pregnancy, the elderly, and patients with
              asthma and liver or renal impairment
          NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with current or past peptic ulceration. Refer
              patients with serious rheumatic disease and peptic ulceration for specialist help.
          NSAIDs should be taken with food
          If dyspeptic symptoms develop in a patient on NSAIDs, try adding magnesium
              trisilicate mixture. If dyspepsia persists and NSAID use considered essential
              antagonist
          Physiotherapy is a useful adjunct treatment in many inflammatory joint conditions

2.1Rheumatoid Arthritis

It is a chronic multisystem disease of unknown aetiology
Diagnosis

         In the majority of patients with RA, the onset is insidious with joint pain, stiffness and
         symmetrical swelling of a number of peripheral joints

Treatment      A: Acetylsalicylic acid 1.2 g every 6 hours with food.
necessary                         OR

               A: Ibuprofen give 400 ­ 800 mg every 8 hours. Continue for a long as it is

NOTE: Patients with intractable symptoms may require special treatment at specialists centre

2.2 Gout

Gout is a recurrent acute arthritis of peripheral joints which results from deposition, in and
about the joints and tendons, of crystals of monosodium urate from supersaturated
hyperuricaemic body fluids. The arthritis may become chronic and forming.

155 | P a g e
Diagnosis
     The main clinical features are those of an acute gouty arthritis, often nocturnal, throbbing
         crushing or excruciating
     The signs resemble an acute infection with swelling, hot red and very tender joints.
     The first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe is frequently involved

Treatment
General principles

     Termination of acute attack
     Prevention of recurrence
     Prevention of further deposition of urate crystals.

Specific treatment for acute attack
                   A: Indomethacin 75 mg (O) start then 50 mg every 6 hours until 24 hours after

         relief of pain.
         Reduce dose to 50 mg every 8 hours for 3 doses then 25 mg every 8 hours for three
         doses

                                       OR
                   A: Diclofenac sodium 75 mg hourly. Continue as long as necessary.

                                       OR
                   A:Ibuprofen: give 400 ­ 800 mg every 8 hours

                                       OR

                   S: Colchicine give 1 mg stat followed by 0.5 mg every 2 hours orally until
patient improves or a maximum of 10 mg is taken or gastrointestinal tract side effects develop.
The course should not be repeated within 3 days.

Prevention of recurrence
     Institute prophylactic indomethacin
     In obese patient, reduce weight
     Avoid precipitants e.g. alcohol
     Institute anti-hyperuricaemic therapy e.g. allopurinol give 100 mg every 8 or 12 hours to
         reduce uric acid synthesis
     Prevention or reversal of deposition of uric acid crystals in males
     Aim is to maintain serum uric acid level below 8 mg/dl (0.48 mmol/1)

2.3 Osteoarthritis

It is a common form of arthritis, characterized by degenerative loss of articular cartilage,
subschondral bony sclerosis, and cartilage and bone proliferation subsequent osteophyte
formation. Cause is unknown, but genetic, metablic and biomechanical have been suggested.
Gradual onset of one or a few joints involved.

Diagnosis
     Pain is the commonest symptom

156 | P a g e
     Specific clinical features depend on the joint involved e.g. enlargement of distal
         interphalangeal joint (Bouchard's nodes)

Treatment guidelines
     Rest the joint . Use crutches or walkers to protect weight bearing joints in severe cases.
         Crepe bandage or braces also can be worn during the active phase of disease.
     Reduction of weight in obese patients
     Physiotherapy ­ exercise to the affected joints

Drug therapy
                   A:Acetylsalicylic acid 600-900 mg orally every 6-8 hours with food

                                                 OR
                   A: Indomethacin 25 mg every 6-8 hours with food

                                                 OR
                   A: Diclofenac sodium (PO)50 mg 8 hourly for 3 ­ 5 days

NOTE: In severe cases surgery may be indicated e.g. hip joint replacement, knee replacement

3.0 LOW BACK PAIN

Low back pain is a common presenting complaint especially among the elderly. It may be a
mild, transient symptom or chronic and disabling complaint.There are many causes of low back
pain but a cause can usually be found from a good clinical history and physical examination. In
some patients however, no cause will be found and these people are described as having
nonspecific back pain. Acute ligamentous (sprain) lesions and muscular strain are usually self-
limiting.

Causes
     Acute ligamentous (sprain) lesions
     Muscular strain
     Chronic osteoarthritis

Other causes include:
     Back strain due to poor posture worsened by mechanical factors like overuse, obesity
         and pregnancy
     A protruding or ruptured intervertebral disk
     Traumatic ligament rupture or muscle tear
     Fracture
     Infection (e.g. tuberculosis or septic discitis)
     Malignancy e.g. metastases, multiple myeloma or spinal tumour, prostatic carcinoma
     Congenital abnormalities e.g. abnormal intervertebral facets, sacralization of L-5
         transverse process
     Spondylolisthesis - i.e. Slipping forward of a vertebra upon the one below
     Narrowed spinal canal from spinal stenosis

157 | P a g e
 Psychogenic pain: The back is a common site of psychogenic pain. Inconsistent historical
    and physical findings on sequential examination may make one suspicious of this
    diagnosis

158 | P a g e
                   C: Tramadol 50 mg (O) 8 hourly for 3 days.
Treatment forChronic low back pain
Non-pharmacological Treatment
Treat the cause, e.g. weight reduction in the obese, improving muscle tone and strength
through physiotherapy, improving posture. Depending on the cause, surgical procedures may
be necessary, e.g. in disc disease or spinal stenosis.
Pharmacological Treatment
Analgesics are given for pain as above. AVOID narcotic analgesics. If symptoms persist, refer
the patient.
Treatment of Psychogenic pain

     Reassurance is needed
     Explore causes
     Treat depression if appropriate
     Give analgesics but AVOID addictive medications, e.g. narcotic analgesics
     Physical therapy may be helpful
At Referral level
Several investigations including X-ray, CT SCAN, MRI, FBP, serum uric acid etc should be
performed according to specialist protocol. Treatment may still be non surgical as above or
otherwise. For radicular pain in chronic low back pain give:

                   S: Gabapentin (O) 300mg 12 hourly
                   C: Vit B1+B6+B121tablets 12 hourly

              KIDNEY AND UROLOGICAL DISORDERS

1.0 KIDNEY DISEASES

1.1 Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD)

It is structural or functional kidney damage present for > 3 months, with or without a
decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Markers of kidney damage include:
     Abnormalities in urine e.g. proteinuria or haematuria,
     Abnormalities in blood e.g. uraemia,
     Abnormalities in imaging tests e.g. small kidneys on ultrasound,
     Abnormalities on pathological specimens' e.g. glomerular disease on renal biopsy.

The creatinine clearance (CrCl) approximates GFR and may be estimated by the following
formula:

Adults
         Males:
         eGFR (mL/minute)= (140­age) x weight (kg)
                                         serum Cr (micromol/L)
         Females:
         Multiply estimated CrCl by 0.85

Children

         eGFR (mL/minute) = K* x height (cm)
                                       Serum Cr (micromol/L)

         Where *K is: infants 0­18 months = 40
                      Girls 2­16 years = 49
                      Boys 2­13 years = 49
                      Boys 13­16 years = 60

Common causes of chronic kidney disease include:
     Hypertension
     Diabetes mellitus
     Glomerular diseases

  Note: Chronic kidney disease can be entirely asymptomatic BUT early detection and
  management can improve the outcome of this condition.

160 | P a g e
Treatment and prevention strategies according to stages
Estimation of the degree of kidney damage and staging is important to guide management and
further prevent adverse outcomes of chronic kidney disease.

Note:
Adults with early CKD i.e. stages 0­3 can all be managed at primary care level once the cause
and plan for care has been established. All children should be referred for investigation and
initial management.

General measures
     Reduce salt intake.
     Low protein diet is indicated in the presence of CKD stage 4 and 5.
     Reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors ­ See section: Prevention of ischaemic heart
         disease and atherosclerosis.

Drug treatment
     Treat underlying conditions.
     Decrease signifi cant proteinuria, if present.

Significant proteinuria = spot urine protein creatinine ratio of > 0.1 g/mmol or ACR (albumin-
creatinine ratio) > 100 g/mol, confirm as positive if raised on at least 2 of 3 occasions, in the
absence of infection, cardiac failure and menstruation.

161 | P a g e
See also section on Diabetic nephropathy

Proteinuria
     In established chronic kidney disease, decrease proteinuria, irrespective of presence or
         absence of systemic hypertension.
     Monitor renal function and potassium especially with impaired renal function.
     If volume depleted, first rehydrate before commencing ACE-inhibitor.
     ACE-inhibitor are contraindicated in:
         - Hyperkalaemia
         - known allergy to ACE-inhibitor
     Begin with low dosage of ACE-inhibitor and titrate up ensuring blood pressure remains in
         normal range and no side effects are present, up to the maximum dose or until the
         proteinuria disappears ­ whichever comes first.

Adults
     ACE inhibitor, e.g.
                             D: Enalapril (O) 10­20 mg 12 hourly.

If ACE inhibitor cannot be used, refer.

Hyperlipidaemia
If hyperlipidaemia is a co-existent risk factor manage according to section
4.1: Prevention of ischaemic heart disease and atherosclerosis

Diabetes mellitus
     In diabetics, optimise control according to section 9.6: Diabetes mellitus type 2, in adults
     Avoid oral hypoglycaemics if GFR is < 60 because of the risk of lactic acidosis with
         metformin and prolonged hypoglycaemia with long acting sulphonylureas.

Hypertension
Treat if present. See Section 4.7: Hypertension

Fluid overload
Treat fluid overload if present and refer.
Adults

                   C: Furosemide 40­80mg slow I.V or oral, 12 hourly.
If poor response, repeat after 1 hour.
Do not give I.V fluids ­ use heparin lock or similar I.V access.

Children
     Furosemide, I.V, 1 mg/kg immediately.
              o Do not put up a drip or run in any I.V fluids

Referral
     All cases of suspected chronic kidney disease stages 3­5 for assessment and planning
     All children
     All cases of CKD with:
              o - haematuria,
              o - proteinuria
              o - raised blood urea or creatinine initially for assessment and planning
     Uncontrolled hypertension/fluid overload
     CKD associated with hyperlipidaemia
     No resolution of proteinuria with ACE-I therapy

Note:Patients who might qualify for dialysis and transplantation or who have complications
should be referred early to ensure improved outcome and survival on dialysis, i.e. as soon as
GFR drops below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, or as soon as diagnosis is made/suspected

1.2 Acute renal failure (ARF)

This is (usually) reversible kidney failure, most commonly as a result of:
     dehydration and fluid loss
     drugs/toxins,
     urinary tract obstruction, and
     acute glomerulonephritis in older children

163 | P a g e
It is often recognised by:
     fluid overload
     decreased or no urine output
     blood result abnormalities of urea, creatinine or electrolytes.
     convulsions in children

General measures
     Give oxygen, and nurse in semi-Fowlers' position if patient has respiratory distress.
         Early referral is essential.
     If fluid overloaded:
         - stop all fluids oral and give no IV fluids
         - stop intake of all salt and potassium containing foods and fluids
     If not overloaded, dehydrated nor shocked:
         - no IV fluids
         - restrict oral fluid intake to 10 mL/kg/day daily plus visible fluid losses
         - arrange referral in the meantime
     If dehydrated or shocked:
         - treat immediately as in shock section.

1.3 Glomerular Diseases (GN)

Glomerular disease may be a result of a primary condition of the kidney, or may be secondary
to a systemic disorder. Can present with any, or a combination of the following:

     Proteinuria
     Reduced GFR (and its effects)
     Haematuria
     Hypertension and oedema.
Approach to care is outlined under the syndromes which follow.

Referral

     Nephritic syndrome
     Nephrotic syndrome
     Chronic Kidney Disease

Note:
Where facilities are available investigation should be done e.g. urine and electrolytes calculate
the GFR or PCR

1.4 Glomerular disease - Nephritic syndrome

Presents with a varied combination of:
     painless macroscopic turbid, bloody or brownish urine
     peripheral and facial oedema
     pulmonary oedema (circulatory overload)
     hypertension or hypertensive encephalopathy with impaired level of consciousness or
         convulsions
     little or no urine excretion

In children this is most commonly due to acute post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, but not
exclusively so.

General measures
     Give oxygen, and nurse in semi-Fowlers position if patient has respiratory distress.
     Early referral essential especially if patient has had a hypertensive episode or fluid
         overload.
     If fluid overloaded:
         - stop all fluids oral and give no I.V fluids
         - stop intake of all salt and potassium containing foods and fluids
     If not overloaded, dehydrated nor shocked:
         - no I.V fluids

» All cases
The definitive treatment of nephritis depends on the cause ­ an assumption of acute post
streptococcal nephritis or any other disease cannot be made without specific investigation which
may include renal biopsy.

1.5 Glomerular disease - Nephrotic syndrome

Glomerular disease characterised by:
     severe proteinuria defi ned as:
           o Children:  3 + proteinuria on dipstick test, or urine protein: creatinine ratio (PCR)
                  0.2 g/mmol on spot urine sample
           o Adults: 2.5 g/day, or greater as determined by a spot urine proteinmeasurement,
                 i.e. protein creatinine ratio (PCR)
     and resultant `classical' clinical picture (not always present) which includes:
           o Oedema and
           o Hypoalbuminaemia and
           o Hyperlipidaemia.

Note: Accurate diagnosis requires a renal biopsy.

Drug treatment
The management of glomerular disease depends on the type/cause of the disease and is
individualised guided by a specialist according to the biopsy result.

Referral
     All cases

1.6 Urinary tract infection (UTI)

Urinary tract infections may involve the upper or lower urinary tract. Infections may be
complicated or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated cystitis is a lower UTI in a non-pregnant woman
of reproductive age and who has a normal urinary tract. All other UTIs should be regarded as
complicated.

Note: Differentiation of upper from lower urinary tract infection in young children is not
possible on clinical grounds.
Upper UTI is a more serious condition and requires longer and sometimes intravenous
treatment. Features of upper UTI (pyelonephritis) that may be detected in adults and
adolescents include:

     flank pain/tenderness
     temperature 38oC or higher
     other features of sepsis, i.e.:

              o tachypnoea,
              o tachycardia
              o confusion, and
              o hypotension
     vomiting

In complicated, recurrent or upper UTIs, urine should be sent for microscopy, culture and
sensitivity.

Features of urinary tract Infections in children
     Signs and symptoms are related to the age of the child and are often nonspecific.
     Uncomplicated urinary tract infections may cause very few signs and symptoms.
     Complicated infections may present with a wide range of signs and symptoms.

     Fever                           Sepsis
     Poor feeding                    Prolonged jaundice
     Vomiting                        Renal failure
     Failure to thrive
                                     frequency
Infants/children may present with:   dysuria
     failure to thrive fever         enuresis or urgency
     persisting fever
     abdominal pain
     diarrhoea

Note: In any child with fever of unknown origin, the urine must be examined.

In children the diagnosis must be confirmed.
If a bag specimen reveals the following, a urine specimen must be collected aseptically for
culture and sensitivity:

     Positive leukocytes or nitrites on dipsticks in freshly passed urine
     Motile bacilli and increased leukocytes or leukocyte casts on urine microscopy

Urine dipstix should be performed on a fresh urine specimen.
     If leucocytes and nitrites are not present, a urinary tract infection is highly unlikely.
     If leucocytes are present on a second specimen, a urinary tract infection must be
         suspected.

General measures
     Women with recurrent UTIs, should be advised to:
              o Void bladder after intercourse and before retiring at night
              o Not postpone voiding when urge to micturate occurs
              o Change from use of diaphragm to an alternative type of contraception

Drug treatment
Empirical treatment is indicated only if:

     Positive leucocytes and nitrites on freshly passed urine, or
     Leucocytes or nitrites with symptoms of UTI, or
     Systemic signs and symptoms.
Alkalinising agents are not advised.

     Recurrent UTI in children for assessment and consideration of prophylaxis

2.0 Urology Disorders

2.1 Haematuria

It is a bleeding from the urinary tract, which can be from the kidneys, collecting system
bladder, prostate and urethra. Glomerular disease is suggested if proteinuria is present as well
as casts on routine microscopy. Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a common cause of haematuria.
Exclude schistosomiasis.

When haematuria is accompanied by colicky pain a kidney stone should be excluded.

171 | P a g e
Note:
The presence of blood on urine test strips does not indicate infection and should be investigated
as above.

Drug Treatment
If evidence of Schistosomiasis ­ treat as in Section 10.13: Schistosomiasis
If symptoms of UTI and leucocytes and nitrite positive in urine ­ treat as UTI

If Haematuria does not resolve rapidly after treatment referral for formal investigation will be
required, i.e. next 48 hours.

Referral
     All cases not associated with schistosomiasis or UTI
     All cases not responding to specific drug treatment

2.2 Prostatitis

It is an infection of the prostate caused by urinary or STI pathogens. Clinical features include:
     perineal, sacral or suprapubic pain
     dysuria and frequency
     varying degrees of obstructive symptoms which may lead to urinary retention
     sometimes fever
     acutely tender prostate on rectal examination

The condition may be chronic, bacterial or non-bacterial, the latter usually being assessed when
there is failure to respond to antibiotics.

Drug treatment

Acute bacterial prostatitis
In men < 35 years or if there are features of associated urethritis (STI regimen):

                   D: Cefixime (O) 400mg as a single dose

Followed by:
                   A: Doxycycline, oral, 100 mg 12 hourly for 7 days

In men > 35 years or if there is associated cystitis:
                   B: Ciprofloxacin, oral, 500 mg 12 hourly for 14 days

Referral
     No response to treatment
     Urinary retention
     High fever
     Chronic/relapsing prostatitis

2.3 Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a noncancerous (benign) growth of the prostate gland.

172 | P a g e
May be associated with both obstructive (weak, intermittent stream and urinary hesitancy) and
irritative (frequency, nocturia and urgency) voiding symptoms. Digital rectal examination reveals
a uniform enlargement of the prostate. Urinary retention with a distended bladder may be
present in the absence of severe symptoms, therefore it is important to palpate for an enlarged
bladder during examination.

General measures
Annual follow-up with digital rectal examination (DRE) is recommended. For patients presenting
with urinary retention, insert a urethral catheter as a temporary measure while patient is
transferred to hospital Remove drugs that prevent urinary outflow e.g. tricyclics and
neuroleptics.

Referral
     All patients with suspected BPH

2.4 Prostate cancer

Usually occurs in men over 50 years and is most often asymptomatic. Systemic symptoms, i.e.
weight loss, bone pain, etc. occurs in 20% of patients. Obstructive voiding symptoms and
urinary retention are uncommon.

The prostate gland is hard and may be nodular on digital rectal examination. As the axial
skeleton is the most common site of metastases, patients may present with back pain or
pathological fractures. Lymph node metastases can lead to lower limb lymphoedema.

Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is generally elevated and may be markedly so in
metastatic disease.

Referral
     All patients with suspected cancer (For more detail refer to the Malignant diseases
         section)

2.5 Enuresis

Enuresis is bedwetting after the age of 5 years. It is a benign condition which mostly resolves
spontaneously. It is important, however, to differentiate between nocturnal enuresis and
enuresis during daytime with associated bladder dysfunction. Secondary causes of enuresis
include:

     diabetes mellitus
     urinary tract infection
     physical or emotional trauma

Note:
Clinical evaluation should attempt to exclude the above conditions. Urine examination should be
done on all patients.

General measures
     Motivate, counsel and reassure child and parents
     Advise against punishment and scolding

173 | P a g e
     Spread fluid intake throughout the day
     Nappies should never be used as this will lower the child's self esteem.
Referral
     Suspected underlying systemic illness or chronic kidney disease
     Persistent enuresis in a child 8 years or older
     Diurnal enuresis

2.6 Erectile dysfunction disorders

It is inability to attain and maintain an erect penis with sufficient rigidity for vaginal penetration.
Organic causes include neurogenic, vasculogenic, endocrinological as well as many systemic
diseases and medications.

General measures
     Thorough medical and psychosexual history
     Physical examination should rule out gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy or penile
         abnormalities.
     Consider the removal of drugs that may be associated with the problem.
     A change in lifestyle or medications may resolve the problem, e.g. advise cessation of
         smoking and alcohol abuse.

Drug treatment
     Treat the underlying condition.
     If persist refer the patient

2.7 Renal calculi

This is a kidney stone or calculus which has formed in the renal tract i.e. pelvis, ureters or
bladder as a result of urine which is supersaturated with respect to a stone-forming salt.
Clinical features of obstructing urinary stones may include:

     Sudden onset of acute colic, localized to the flank, causing the patient to move
         constantly.

     nausea and vomiting
     referred pain to the scrotum or labium on the same side as the stone moves down the

         ureter
Urinalysis usually reveals microscopic or macroscopic haematuria.

General measures
     Ensure adequate hydration.

Drug treatment
Adults:
Analgesia for pain, if needed:

                   C: Morphine, 10­15 mg, IM/slow IV as a single dose and refer.

Referral
     All patients

                                 CHAPTER TEN

                 EAR, NOSE AND THROAT DISEASES

1.0 OTITIS (EXTERNA AND MEDIA)

It is an inflammatory condition of the pinna, external auditory meatus and/or the middle ear
cavity.

1.1 Otitis externa

Diagnosis

     Itchy, dry and scaly ear canal and painful ear
     There may be a water or purulent discharge and intermittent deafness
     Pain may become extreme when the ear canal becomes completely occluded with

         edematous skin and debris.
Treatment

     Exclude an underlying chronic otitis media before commencing treatment
     Do a thorough aural toilet at least once a week (ear suctioning under direct vision
     Instruct the patient to thoroughly clean the ear with a cotton wick regularly and keep it

         dry
     Give adult and children:

                   A: Aluminium diacetate drops 3%, instill 3-4 drops every 6 hours after cleaning
                   and drying the ear for 5 days (to reduce edema of the external auditory canal)

                                                 OR

                   C: Gentamycin ear drops 3-4 drops 8 hourly for 7 days or more

                                                 OR

                   C: Ciprofloxacin ear drops 3-4 drops 8 hourly for 7 days or more

                                              OR

                   C: Boric acid ear drops 3-4 drops 6 hourly for 7 days or more

1.2 Otitis media (acute or chronic)

Diagnosis

     Ear pain, a sensation of fullness in the ear, hearing loss
     If the tympanic membrane has perforated, there is an aural discharge
     Onset usually follows an upper respiratory tract infection.
     Chronic otitis media is nearly always associated with perforation of the eardrum.
Investigation: Examine the pinna; using an otoscope carefully examine the external auditory
canal and the tympanic membrane

175 | P a g e
    I. Acute otitis media
It is acute purulent exudates in the middle ear without ear discharge not more than 12 weeks
duration

Diagnosis
     Previous common cold
     Painful ears
     Restlessness
     Usually feverish
     Hearing often reduced
     Inflamed buldged tympanic membrane

    II. Acute suppurative otitis media
It is acute purulent exudates in the middle ear cavity with an ear discharge (perforated
tympanic membrane) of not more than 12 weeks duration

Diagnosis
          Discharge of pus from ear
          Perforated tympanic membrane

Treatment of Acute otitis media & acute suppurative otitis media
Acute otitis media should be treated with analgesics, antibiotics and/or paracentesis. Culture of
a discharge (if any) could be of a great help to identify the causative bacteria.

         Drugs
Adults

                   A: Phenoxymethylpenicillin250 ­ 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 days

Children up to 5 years: 6 mg/kg every 6 hours for 7 days; 6-12 years:
        250 mg every 6 hours for 7 days or more

NOTE:Treatment periods shorter than seven days increase the risk of treatment failure

                   A: Amoxicillin:500mg 8 hourly for 7 days
                   Children 40mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses (max. 3g daily)

Erythromycin: Adult and children above 8 years 250 ­ 500 mg every 6-8 hours for 7 days
or more

Symptomatic treatment of acute otitis media

              Analgesics
                  A: Paracetamol 10 mg/kg body weights every 6-8 hours
                                       OR
                  A: Acetylsalicylic acid
                    Avoid Acetysalicylilc acid if it is a viral infection

              Bed rest

              Decongestive nasal drops or nasal spray e.g.

                  C:Ephedrine hydrochloride1-2 drops into each nostril up to 3-4 times dailyfor not
                  more than 5 days

         Referral to ENT specialists

          Children with high fever who are toxic or children with severe ear pain, headache,
              altered state of consciousness

          A chronically discharging ear that persists in spite of proper treatment.
          Foul smelling ear discharge
          Mastoiditis
          "Ear Children"
          Otitis in the normal (or better hearing) ear combined with permanent hearing loss in

              the other ear.

    III. Mastoiditis with subperiosteal abcess
It is due to infection of the mastoid air cells in the middle ear, a complication of otitis media. It
presents as a fluctuants painful swelling on the post auricular area. The overlying skin is
inflamed.

Treatment
Aspirate the swelling before incision and drainage, and then refer

    IV. Secretory otitis media
It is a multifactorial non-purulent inflammatory condition in the middle ear with serous or
mucous discharge. Also there is a residual condition after acute otitis.

Diagnosis
          Little or no pain
          Gradual loss of hearing
          No ear discharge
          often discovered by chance

Treatment

          Close follow-up
          Nasal drops, oral decongestants and antihistamines have no demons ratable effect

              on this condition
          Secretory otitis with hearing loss that does not improve should be referred to a

              specialist

2.0 ACUTE RHINITIS AND SINUSITIS

Itis inflammation of the mucosal lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, almost always
occurring concurrently, thus also referred as rhinosinusitis, of not more than 12 weeks duration.
Rhinitis is caused by a variety of viruses. Acute sinusitis starts with obstruction of the sinus
ostium due to mucosal edema from a viral infection, followed by reduced sinus ventilation,
retention of mucous in the sinus and bacterial multiplication. If the ostium is blocked for a long

177 | P a g e
period, sinus empayema occurs. The bacteria most often causing purulent sinusitis are
pneumococci and Haemophilus influenzae which in some studies are shown to be equally
common. Moraxella catarrhalis and group A streptococci also occur. In sinusitis of dental origin,
anaerobic bacteria are often found.

2.1 Acute rhinitis

It is a viral inflammatory condition in the nasal mucous membrane, usually part of a more wide-
spread infection of the upper respiratory tract.

Treatment
     Bed rest
                  C: Ephedrine hudrochloride (1% for adults and 0.5% for children)1-2 drops into
                  each nostril up to 3-4 times dailyfor not more than 5 days
                                       OR

                   C: Beclomethasone nasal spray adult and child over 6 years, 100 micrograms (2
      sprays) into each nostril twice daily; max. Total 400 micrograms (8 sprays) daily; when
      symptoms controlled, dose reduced to 50 micrograms (1 spray) into each nostril twice
      daily

Oral drugs to reduce swelling of the mucous membrane, antihistamines and antibiotics are not
indicated.

2.2 Acute purulent sinusitis

Bacterial infection with pus accumulation in one or more of the sinuses

Diagnosis

Note: Cephalexin and macrolides (e.g. Erythromycin etc) are not suitable because of poor
effect on Haemophilus influenza. Treatment duration of less than 2 weeks will result in
treatment failure

         Referral to specialist
     Children with ethmoiditis presenting as an acute periorbital inflammation or orbital

         cellulitis must be hospitalized immediately
     Adults with treatment failure and pronounced symptoms
     If sinusitis of dental origin is suspected
     Recurrent sinusitis (>3 attacks in a year) or chronic sinusitis (duration of illness of >12

         weeks)

2.3 Allergic rhinitis

It is irritation of the nasal mucosa by an allergen in a previously sensitized individual.l
Common allergens include house dust (mite's feaces), pollens, cockroach antigen, animal
dander, moulds (in-door)

Diagnosis
     Itchy nostrils, throat, eyes
     Watery nasal discharge
     Nasal congestion
     Sneezing

Investigation
     Anterior rhinoscopy ­ watery nasal discharge, nasal congestion
     Skin allergy test

Treatment
     Avoidance of an allergen (if possible)

179 | P a g e
     Antihistamines (Cetrizen 10mg daily for adults, 5mg daily for children aged 2-6 years )
     Steroid nasal spray (Beclomethasone one puff each nostril 3 times a day)

3.0 PHARYNGOTONSILLITIS

It is an acute inflammation of the pharynx and/tonsils, characterized by fever and a painful
throat. Pharyngotonsillitis is caused by virus or bacteria. Clinical important pathogens are group
A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GAS) and Epstein ­ Barr virus (EBV). In practice GAS is an
indication for treatment with antibiotics.

Treatment
     As general rule pharyngotonsillitis caused by GAS should be treated with antibiotics
     If treatment is begun early, duration of the illness can be shortened.
     Antibiotics can hinder the spread of infection and reduce the risk of complications.
                   A: Phenoxymethylpenicillin: 500 mg every 8 hours for 10 days
                                       OR

                   A:Paracetamol 10 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours until fever controlled

NOTE: Duration of treatment is ten days. Shorter treatment involves increased risk of therapy
failure

Refer the patient to the specialist with tonsillitis if
     Chronic tonsillitis
     Recurrent tonsillitis (>3 attacks in a year or 5 or more attacks in 2 years)
     Obstructive tonsillitis (causing an upper airway obstruction)

4.0 LARYNGITIS

This is an infectious/non infectious, acute/chronic inflammatory condition of the larynx.
Etiological agents include viruses (for acute laryngitis), bacteria, fungi, laryngeal reflux disease,
thermal injuries, cigarette smoking, trauma (vocal cord abuse), and granulomatous conditions
(for chronic laryngitis).

The picture of the disease is different in children and adults due to the small size of the larynx
in children. Acute subglottic laryngitis (pseudocroup) occurs mainly in children under the age of
seven, it is a viral infection. Edema of the mucous membrane of the subglottic space causes
breathing difficulties, especially on inspiration. Laryngitis in children may require active
treatment.

180 | P a g e
Treatment
     Symptomatic treatment (acute laryngitis)
              Parents should behave calmly and avoid frightening the child
              Bed rest
              Keep the air damp and cold
              Give extra fluid
              Nasal drops or spray may be helpful
              If symptoms persist or worsen, seek medical advice

     Drug treatment in general practice
    Epinephrine (Adrenaline) inhalation effectively reduces symptoms, but the effect may be
    short ­ lived

Table 1: Dosage of racemic epinephrine preparation

Age          Racemic Epinephrine                    0.9% Saline
             (20 mg/ml)
0-6 months   0.1 ml                                 2 ml
6-12 months  0.15 ml                                2 ml

NOTE : The total fluid volume, is inhaled in 5 minutes with the use of inhalator

 Hospitalization
If severe symptoms persist or worsen or recur after Epinephrine inhalation hospitalization is
indicated

 Symptomatic treatment (chronic laryngitis)
     Voice rest
     Stop smoking
     Nasal drops or spray
     Rehydration
     Antireflux/antibiotics/antifungals

Referral to specialist
               Chronic laryngitis

5.0 ACUTE EPIGLOTITIS (AE)

Itis an acute infectious inflammation of the epiglottis, supraglottic and hypopharynx. Epiglottitis
is a potentially lethal disease. Edema of the epiglottis may cause acute airway obstruction.
Epiglottitis occurs both in children and adults. Haemophilus influenzae is often the cause.

Diagnosis
AE is characterized by throat pain, difficulty swallowing, drooling, husky voice, fever often high
and with chills; patients prefer sitting posture with an extended neck, laborious inspiration,
cough in some cases and anxiety.

181 | P a g e
Investigation: Plain X ray of the neck, lateral view characteristically presents with a positive
thumb sign (edematous epiglottis)

Treatment
          Immediate hospitalization, preferably in the ICU
          Transportation: sitting, with oxygen supplementation
          Be prepared to treat respiratory failure (intubation or tracheotomy)
          Antibiotics may be given if transport lasts more than one hour.

6.0 RECURRENT RESPIRATORY PAPILLOMATOSIS (LARYNGEAL
PAPILLOMAS)

It is the commonest benign laryngeal tumor of the larynx caused by Human papilloma virus
(HPV), occurring in both children and adults. It has a higher recurrence rate in children than in
adults, among adults it may turn into a malignancy

Diagnosis
          Progressive hoarseness of voice
          Progressive difficulty in breathing
          Progressive inspiratory stridor
          On and off cough

Investigation
     Physical examination
    - thorough respiratory system examination
    - hoarse voice, audible respiration (inspiratory stridor)
    - indirect laryngoscopy ­ papilloma croups on the larynx
     Chest X ray - ?foreign body inhalation, ?pneumonia (coincidental finding)

Treatment
     Refer the patient for microlaryngeal surgery
     If in distress, perform a tracheostomy first then refer

7.0 EPISTAXIS

It is nose bleeding. May be due to a local cause (in the nasal cavity ­ trauma, tumor, foreign
body, septal varisces, septal deviation) or due to a systemic cause (blood disorders, vascular
disorders, renal failure, hepatic failure, use of anticoagulants (wafarin, heparin)

Management
Stabilize the patient: put an open intravenous line, blood grouping and cross matching. Put the
patient in a sitting position, put on a gown, glasses, and head light, sterile gloves. Advise the
patient to pinch the soft part of the nose gently for 3 minutes. Evacuate clots and do a
thorough head and neck examination. Remove a foreign body; cauterize septal varisces using a
silverex stick

182 | P a g e
If the patient is still bleeding do an anterior nasal packing by introducing as far posterior as
possible sterile vaseline gauzes (or iodine soaked gauzes if not available) using a dissecting
forcep (if bayonet forcep is not available). Put rolled dry gauze on the nose and plaster it.
If the patient is still bleeding do a posterior nasal packing using a Folley's catheter introduced
through the nasal cavity into the oropharynx, balloon it with normal saline up to 10-15cc while
pulling it outward to impinge on the posterior nasal coana, then do anterior nasal packing as
above. Put dry gauze on the nose to prevent necrosis and fix the catheter on the nose with an
umbilical clamp. Almost all of the nasal bleedings will be controlled by this way. Put the patient
on oral antibiotics (Amoxycillin 500mg 8 hourly for 5 days), analgesics (Paracetamol 1g 8 hourly
for 5 days) and trenaxamic acid 500mg 8 hourly for 3 days. Remove the packs after 72 hours.
Put an ice cube on the forehead, extending the neck or placing a cotton bud soaked with
adrenaline in the vestibule will not help
Referral

     If the patient is still bleeding repack and refer immediately
     Failure to manage the underlying cause, refer the patient

8.0 FOREIGN BODIES

In the ear, nasal cavity ­ remove using a cerumen hook or a hooked office pin under direct
vision using a head light. Refer if the foreign body is in the bronchus, trachea or hypopharynx.

                              CHAPTER ELEVEN

                       EYE DISEASE CONDITIONS

1.0 MAJOR BLINDING DISEASES

Blindness is defined as a Visual Acuity of less than 3/60 with the best correction available or
central visual field of less than 10º in the better eye by WHO definition. In a simpler way, it is
when some one fails to count fingers at a distance of 3 meters in the eye that is considered
good with the best available corrective/distance spectacles. The definition is the same to
children and infants though there are different methods for testing vision in young children until
when they are at pre school age when normal visual acuity chart can be used.

The common causes of blindness are Cataract, Glaucoma, Trachoma, and Vitamin A Deficiency,
Diseases of the Retina, uncorrected Refractive Errors and Low Vision.

1.1 Cataract

Diagnosis

     Cloudiness in the lens seen as a white mark behind the pupil and iris
     Conjunctiva and cornea are clear and the whole iris can be seen clearly
Referral
Refer all cases to eye surgeon for cataract surgery. Children should be referred immediately to
a Paediatric Eye Tertiary Centre as white pupil may be a tumor in the eye. Late treatment of
cataract in children may lead to permanent loss of vision, low vision or squint.

NOTE:

     Cataract may present in all age groups
     Blindness due to cataract is reversible.
     Treatment is only by surgery which takes approximately 20 minutes.
     Early treatment in children is mandatory

1.2 Glaucoma

There are mainly 4 clinical types of glaucoma.

    I. Primary Open angle glaucoma
    Diagnosis
     Present as painless loss of peripheral vision
     Affects adults of 40 years of age and above
     Cornea and conjunctiva are clear
     Pupil in the affected eye does not react with direct light.
     The optic nerve is always damaged through fundoscopy
     One eye may be affected than the other
     First degree relatives of glaucoma patients are at risk

184 | P a g e
     All suspected cases of glaucoma should be referred to qualified eye care personnel.

NOTE:
Primary Open Angle Glaucoma does not have symptoms in early stages, hence routine
intraocular pressure check up and fundus examinations should be done in all people of 40 years
and above

Treatment

Treatment of Primary Open Angle Glaucoma may be surgical or medical. Medical treatment is
given to patients with good compliance (targeted intraocular pressure level reached). If medical
treatment is given, it should be life long unless there are conditions necessitating other
interventions. Surgical treatment is usually preceded by medical treatment.

Medical Treatment
 Topical Beta-blockers

                   D: Timolol 0.25% or 0.5% Instil one drop in the affected eye 12 hourly.
                    This is a first line treatment and it should be used with caution in patients with
         Asthma and cardiac diseases.

                                       OR
 Topical Parasympathomimetics

                   C: Pilocarpine hydrochloride 2 or 4% Instil one drop in the affected eye given at
                   an interval of 6 hourly.
This medicine causes long-standing pupil constriction so it should not be used unless a patient
is prepared for glaucoma surgery or as an alternative topical treatment for patients who are
contraindicated for Timolol use.
 Topical Prostaglandin analogue:
                   D: Latanoprost 0.005% Instil one drop once a day

                                       OR
                   D: Prostamide bimatoprost 0.03% Instil one drop once a day.
 Systemic Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors:
                   C: Acetazolamide 250 mg 6 hourly for one or two days or until the intraocular
         pressure is lower than 40 mmHg.

Surgical Treatment
     It is done in all patients with poor compliance or when prescribed topical medicines are
         unavailable or unaffordable.
     Surgical treatment is encouraged as a primary treatment in all glaucoma cases in
         developing countries due to poor compliance to medical treatment.

II. Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma
This is also known as Congestive Glaucoma and commonly affect people aged 40 years and
above.

Diagnosis
     Patients present with acute painful red eye in the affected eye
     Severe headache and cloudiness of the cornea
     There is usually dramatic visual impairment and vomiting may be present

185 | P a g e
NOTE:
     Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma is an Ophthalmological Emergency
     Refer all patients with Congestive Glaucoma to eye specialist after initial treatment

Treatment Guideline
First Line Treatment

                   C: Mannitol IV 1-2mg/kg body weight to run slowly over 30 -45 minutes
                                       OR

                   D: Glycerol syrup (O)1-2 g/kg body weight stat.

These medicines have diuretic effects so they are only used as a single dose. They are also
used in emergencies to prepare patients with high intraocular pressure for surgery as they
lower intraocular pressure rapidly.

Second Line Treatment
As for Primary Open Glaucoma.

III. Congenital Glaucoma
     Presents from birth to 5 years.
     It is a syndrome where by the intraocular pressure is raised and cause abnormality of
         the eyeball and visual disturbances even blindness.

Diagnosis
     Patients presents with bigger eyes than normal for age (buphthalmos)
     Photophobia
     Tearing
     Cloudy cornea,
     Red conjunctiva though not severe.

Treatment
Treatment is usually surgery, which is done by pediatric ophthalmologist.

Referral
Refer any child who have the above mentioned signs and you suspect that he/she is having
congenital glaucoma to a specialist at a Paediatric Eye Tertiary centre.

IV. Secondary Glaucoma
This presents as a complication of other eye diseases such as uveitis, hypermature cataract,
trauma and retinal diseases. It may also be due to prolonged use of steroids

Diagnosis
     Poor vision in the affected eye
     High intraocular pressure
     New vessels on the iris if the cause is retinal diseases

Treatment Guideline
Management of these patients is retrobulbar alcohol injection 99% in the affected eye or laser
photocoagulation treatment (Cyclophotocoagulation) in thrombotic glaucoma. Treatment of the
pre existing eye disease is highly recommended.

186 | P a g e
Referral
Refer all patients suspected to have secondary glaucoma to a qualified specialist

1.3 Trachoma

It is a chronic conjunctivitis caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. It is one of the
commonest causes of blindness worldwide. There is a chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva
leading to scarring of the upper eyelid tarsal plate, entropion and in turn of eyelashes.

Note:Trachoma reservoirs are infected children and mothers in hyper endemic areas. The
infection is spread by direct contact through Flies, Fomites (kanga, towels) and Fingers, in
poorly hand hygienic conditions.

Diagnosis
       Patients presents with photophobia in early stages or re- infection
       Follicles in the upper tarsal plate seen as round and white nodules in active diagnostic.
       In late stages, In-turned eyelashes rub on the cornea leading to corneal ulcers
       Loss of vision due to Corneal Scarring.

Clinical Stages according to World Health Organization
Trachomatous Inflammation Follicular (TF) - Presence of at least 5 follicles on the upper tarsal
plate.
Trachomatous Inflammation Intense (TI) ­ There is intense inflammation, the conjunctival
blood vessels cannot be seen.
Trachomatous Scarring (TS) ­ Presence of white scars in the upper tarsal plate
Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) ­ Presence of some eye lashes rubbing against the cornea
Corneal Opacity (CO) ­ Presence of corneal opacity (scar) affecting the central cornea

Treatment and Prevention
World Health Organization recommended treatment and prevention strategy for Trachoma
known as SAFE. The components of SAFE strategy are:

 Surgical correction of entropion in TT patients. This procedure can be done at a Dispensary
      or Health Centre at community level by a trained health worker.

 Antibiotic treatment of individual cases with TF and TI to prevent transmission as follows:-
                   A: Oxytetracycline ointment 3% once a day for 6 weeks
                                                                  OR
                   C: Azithromycin 1g as a single dose for adults- for preventive chemotherapy in

         mass treatment campaign.
          The regimen for children is as shown below:-

               Table 1: Dosage of Azithromycin in children

               Weight (kg)  I-day Regimen

               < 15         20mg/kg once daily

1.4 Vitamin A Deficiency

Vitamin a deficiency is associated with higher infants and childhood mortality rate particularly
associated with Measles. The age group at risk of blindness due to Vitamin A deficiency is 6
months to 6 years.

Ocular Manifestations

Xerophthalmia is a term used to describe the ocular symptoms and signs of Vitamin A
Deficiency which are:-

     Night Blindness - Patients presents/complain of poor vision during the night or in dim

         light
     Conjunctival Xerosis - It is a dry appearance of the conjunctiva
     Bitot Spots - This is an advanced stage of Conjunctival xerosis presenting as a localized

         white foamy appearance most often on the temporal conjunctiva

     Corneal xerosis - It is a dry appearance of the cornea
     Corneal ulceration with Xerosis ­ It is an advanced stage of corneal xerosis where you

         have ulceration of the cornea
     Corneal Ulceration/Keratomalacia - It is a corneal melting that is of abrupt onset. It

         presents in severe Vitamin A Deficiency
     Corneal Scarring - It is the end stage of malnutrition in children who survive. Corneal

         scarring often has a marked effect on vision

Treatment
Give Vitamin A capsules and emphasize on diet containing dark-green-leafy vegetables

188 | P a g e
Ocular Treatment
Give Tetracycline or Chloramphenical 1% eye ointment 8 hourly and avoid corneal exposure.

Prevention
 Give mothers Vitamin A 200,000 IU after delivery
 Encourage breastfeeding
 Give Vitamin A supplementation routinely, through Vitamin A campaigns and to children

      with measles
 Measles Immunization
 Encourage mothers and weaned children to take adequate foods that are rich in Vitamin A
 Weaning foods should be rich in Vitamin A e.g. mangoes, papaya, darky green leafy

      vegetables.

1.5 Diseases of the Retina

Main diseases of the retina that causes blindness are Diabetic Retinopathy and Age related
Macular Degeneration.
I. Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a well recognized complication of diabetes mellitus. It is a chronic
progressive sight threatening disease of the retinal blood vessels associated with the prolonged
hyperglycemia and other conditions linked to diabetic mellitus such as hypertension.

Diabetic Retinopathy is grouped into three: Background Diabetic Retinopathy, Diabetic
maculopathy and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.

Diagnosis: Is reached by doing fundoscopy in a well dilated pupil, Optical Coherence
Tomography and or Fluorescene Angiography. Optical Coherence Tomography and Fluorescene
Angiography are done in specialized eye clinics.
Treatment
Laser photocoagulation, extent and type of this treatment depending on the stage of the
disease. Dilate the pupils with

                   C:Tropicamide eye drops 0.5 or 1 %
                                       Plus

                   C:Phenylephrine eye drops 2.5%
                                       OR

                   C:Tropicamide 0.8%/Phenylephrine 5% eye drops.

Medical Treatment: By intravitreal injection of

                   D: Bevacizumab 1.25 mg per 0.05ml stat

                                       OR

                   D: Ranibizumab 0.5 mg per 0.05ml.

189 | P a g e
  NOTE:
        Poorly controlled diabetes and diabetic retinopathy can lead to blindness
        There are no warning symptoms in early stages of diabetic Retinopathy
        Diabetic retinopathy may be present without any symptoms
        All patients with Diabetes Mellitus should be screened/examined by an eye specialist
        Dilated eye examination and direct viewing of the retina by an ophthalmologist or
           qualified eye care personnel is mandatory.
        All diabetic patients with sudden loss of vision should be referred to eye specialist
        Blindness from Diabetic Retinopathy can be prevented in earlystages through laser
           photocoagulation or surgery and intravitreal injection in advanced/ proliferativestage.

Surgical Treatment, this is done in the proliferative stage by eye speacialist.

Age Related Macular Degeneration
This is a disease condition, which is characterized by progressive macular changes that are
associated with increase in age. It then results in the gradual deterioration of the vision and
eventually loss of vision from the center of the field of vision.

Age Related Macular Degeneration is associated with accumulation of abnormal materials in the
inner layers of the Retina at the macula. These changes are seen as yellowish excrescence in
the retina called drusens. The disease is common in elderly over 60 years. The only symptom in
this condition initially is poor central vision, later can lead to blindness. It is diagnosed by
fundoscopy through a well-dilated pupil, Optical Coherence Tomography and or Fluorescene
Angiography as for Diabetic Retinopathy.

Treatment
Intravitreal injection of Bevacizumab (Avastin) or Ranibizumab (Lucentis) in the affected eye
given by vitreoretinal specialist in specialized eye clinics (dosage as in diabetic retinopathy).

1.6 Refractive Errors and Low Vision

Refractive Errors
This is a condition where one presents with poor vision either at near or distance at any age.
There are mainly 4 types of refractive errors namely presbyopia, myopia, astigmatism and
hyperopia. A patient may have more than one type of refractive error.

I. Presbyopia:This commonly occurs as people get older. It usually starts after the age of 40
years. The main complain is difficulty in reading/writing or doing near works. Diagnosis is only
through Refraction. This is a good opportunity for screening of glaucoma and diabetic
retinopathy so it is very important that eyes are examined properly before testing for
spectacles.

Treatment: is by provision of plus lens (Convex) spectacles for near vision

    II. Myopia (Short Sightedness): This is a condition whereby patient complains of
              difficulty to see far objects. It is common in young age between 5 to 25 years. The
              condition persists throughout life. If not treated early it may progress rapidly and
              lead to retinal complications. It is diagnosed through refraction.

190 | P a g e
              Treatment: Is with minus lens (Concave) spectacles. These spectacles should be
              worn all the time.

III. Hypermetropia (Long Sightedness): This is a condition where patients have difficulty
in seeing near objects. This condition is less manifested in children as they have a high
accommodative power. As a person grows older, accommodation decreases and patients may
complain of ocular strain. Diagnosis in children should be reached after refraction through a
pupil that is dilated.

Treatment: Is by plus lens (Convex) spectacles.

  Note:
   Spectacles should be given to children who have only significant

       hypermetropia (more than +3.00 Diopter of Sphere both eyes)
   To all children who present with squint and have significant hypermetropia

       and
   To elderly who present with signs of ocular strain.

IV. Astigmatism: This is a condition where the cornea and sometimes the lens have different
radius of curvature in all meridians (different focus in different planes). Some myopic and
hyperopic patients may have astigmatism. It presents with poor vision at distance, sometimes
there is headache. Diagnosis is reached through refraction and treatment is with astigmatic
cylindrical lenses.
V. Low Vision
A person with low vision is one with irreversible visual loss and reduced ability to perform many
daily activities such as recognizing people in the streets, reading black boards, writing at the
same speed as peers and playing with friends. These patients have visual impairment even with
treatment and or standard refractive correction and have a visual acuity of less than 6/18 to
perception of light and a reduced central visual field. Assessment of these patients is thorough
eye examination to determine the causes of visual loss by Low vision therapist.
Treatment

     Surgical intervention if indicated e.g if a patient has cataract
     Assessment of the patients' visual function
     Accurate refraction and provision of spectacles if indicated
     Assessment for/and prescription of low vision devices such as optical devices

         (magnifiers, telescopes) and or non optical devices (reading stands and or reading slits).

Referral
All children with Low Vision should be referred to a Paediatric Tertiary Eye Centre

2.0 RED EYES

The following disease conditions presents with an acute onset of red eyes: ocular trauma,
corneal ulcer, uveitis and conjunctivitis

191 | P a g e
2.1 Ocular Trauma

There are four types of eye injuries and their management depends on the history. The 4 types
of ocular injuries are Perforating Injury, Blunt Injury, Foreign Bodies and Burns or chemical
injuries. From the history, one will be able to know the type of injury that will guide the
management.

I. Perforating eye injury: This is trauma with sharp objects like thorns, needles, iron nails,
pens, knives, wire etc.

Diagnosis
 There is a cut on the cornea and or sclera
 A cut behind the globe might not be seen but the eye will be soft and relatively smaller than

    the fellow eye.
 The pupil may be irregular or not visible
 Part of the intraocular structures like iris or lens may be protruding out with blood into the

    anterior chamber
 There may be eyelids involvement.

Treatment
 Apply an eye shield

                   B:Tetanus Toxoid 0.5 ml intramuscular stat as prophylaxis

    NOTE:
     Eye ointment should be applied very gently and in the lower fornix (behind the lower

         eyelid).
     Do not apply pressure on the eye in perforating injuries of the eyeball.
     Delay in surgical management of the injury may cause irreversible blindness or may

         necessitate removal of an eye.

    Refer the patient to eye surgeon immediately

Surgery: This is done by a well trained eye specialist within 48 hours of injury.

The injury should be repaired and giveA: Gentamycin 200µg in 0.1 ml injection stat given in the
anterior chamber.

Analgesics
Give Paracetamol, dosage as above.

B. Surgical Treatment
This is indicated in patients with hyphema and persistent high intraocular pressure despite
treatment with antiglaucoma medicines (5 days), with or without corneal blood staining.
Surgical procedure is washing of the blood clot from the anterior chamber and Observe
intraocular pressure post operative.

Refer corneal ulcer treatment

III. Foreign bodies

This is a condition whereby something like piece of metal, vegetable or animal parts entering
into any part of the eye.

Diagnosis
     There may be pain, redness, excessive tearing and photophobia if the foreign body is on
         the corneal or eye lids
     If the foreign body is superficial, it can be seen
     There may be loss of vision

 Refer to the nearest eye specialist for removal
 Never pad an eye that was injured with a vegetable material, apply antibiotic ointment and

    refer.

IV. Burns and chemical injuries
This is a condition that occurs when chemicals such as acid or alkali, snake spit, insect bite,
traditional eye medicine, cement or lime enter the eye. It may also be caused by open flame
burn to eyelids.

Diagnosis
     Diagnosis relies mostly with patients' history
     Patients may present with photophobia
     Excessive tearing
     Cloudiness of cornea
     Loss of conjunctival blood vessels
     Traces of chemical substance such as cement or herbs and blisters or loss of eyelid skin
         in open flame injuries.

Treatment Guidelines
This is an Ophthalmological emergency. If a patient gives a history of being in contact with the
above, the following should be done:
 Irrigate the eye with clean water continually for a minimum of 20 ­ 30 minutes
 Test the patients' vision and examine the eye
 Apply eye ointment (Chloramphenical or Tetracycline)
 Refer to eye Specialist for more care.
 For open flame injuries, apply eye ointment if the patient can not open or close the eye or if

    there are signs of involvement of the eyeball.

2.2 Corneal Ulcer

Corneal ulcer is a raw discontinuity to the corneal epithelium leading to a painful red eye. This
may be caused by Infection (bacterial, viral e.g Herpes simplex virus and measles, fungal),
Trauma (physical, chemical) and Nutritional (Vitamin A deficiency)

Diagnosis
     Painful and red eye of acute onset
     It may be accompanied by excessive tearing
     Severe photophobia
     Poor vision and gray/white spot on the cornea

195 | P a g e
     Pupil may be normal

Treatment
Infectious Corneal Ulcers
 These patients are managed by eye specialists
 Apply eye ointment and shield then refer to eye specialist

In specialized eye unit, the following should be done:
 Examination of the eye,
 Use Fluorescene sodium drops or a drop of local anaesthetic on a fluorescene strip to assess

    the pattern of the ulcer and measure the size of corneal defect
 Corneal scrapping for Gram Stain and Potassium Hydroxide staining, while waiting for

    results, give patient the following medicines as in section 11.3.1
         Antibiotics to cover both gram negative and gram positive organisms,

                   C: Gentamycin 0.3% given hourly or 2 hourly depending on the eye condition for
                   3-14 days

Traumatic Corneal Ulcers
The management of these patients is outlined in section 11.3.1 above except for corneal
abrasion.
Patient with corneal abrasion complains of pain, gritty sensation and excessive tearing.

196 | P a g e
 Apply antibiotic ointment and pad
 Review after 24 hours. If signs and symptoms persist, refer to the eye specialist

2.3 Uveitis

This is an eye condition where there is Inflammation of the uveal tissue (Iris, choroid, and
ciliary body). Majority of the cases are Idiopathic where by other cases are due to autoimmune
diseases e.g Rheumatoid Arthritis, Viral and Systemic diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy, and
Syphilis.

Diagnosis
It has 3 main clinical presentations namely acute, chronic and acute on chronic. In acute type,
patients present with painful red eye, Excessive tearing and severe photophobia. Visual Acuity is
usually reduced and the pupil is small or it may be irregular due to syneachia. With Slitlamp
biomicroscopic examination, cells and keratic precipitates and hypopyon may be seen in the
anterior chamber.

Treatment
Treatment of uveitis may be multidisciplinary approach as various specialists may be involved.
Before starting treatment, investigations such as blood tests and X-Rays should be done to
establish the cause of uveitis. Acute uveitis is a serious problem and the patient should be
referred urgently for Specialist treatment. Treatment for uveitis is mainly steroids and specific
treatment according to the cause. Strong dilating drops are given to break down posterior
synechiae

     Topical Steroid:
                   C: Dexamethasone 1% eye drops 3hrly

197 | P a g e
2.4 Conjunctivitis

Conjuctivitis means inflammation of the conjunctiva. It is one of the most common causes of
red eyes. The causes may be bacterial, viral or allergy. Clinical features and treatment guideline
depends on the type and cause of conjunctivitis as shown in the following sections.

Allergy Conjunctivitis: In this conditionpatients presents with history of itching of eyes, sand
sensation, and sometimes discharge. When examined, the eyes may be white or red, there
may also be other pathognomonic signs such as limbal hyperpigmentatin and papillae and
papillae of the upper tarsal conjunctiva. In very advanced stages, allergic conjunctivitis patients
may present with corneal complications.

Treatment
Treatment depends on the severity of the condition.

     Mild cases where the eyes are white, advice the patient to wash the face with clean cool
         water four times a day.
                   C: Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 0.75% (artificial tears) drops 6 hourly for 14 days

     In moderate cases who presents with papillae on examination, give mast cell stabilizer
         such as
                   C: Sodium cromoglycate 2 or 4 % eye drops 6 hourly per day for at least one
                   month.
                                       OR
                   C: Iodoxamide tromethazine 0.1%(Alomide) eye drops 6 hourly per day for at least
                   one month.

                                       Plus
         C: Zinc sulphate 0.25% eye drops 6 hourly per day for at least one month.
     In severe cases where there is involvement of cornea, apart from mast cell stabilizers,
         give short term steroid eye drops.

                   C: Dexamethasone 0.1% 6 hourly may be given for a maximum of 14 days
                                       OR

                   C: Prednisolone 0.5% 6 hourly may be given for a maximum of 14 days.
     In very severe form of allergic conjunctivitis, steroid injection is given

                   D: Triamcinolone acetonide 20 mg/ml
                                       OR

                   D: Methyprednisolone sodium acetate 20mg/ml subtenon stat.
All patients with moderate to severe allergic conjunctivitis should be referred to eye specialist
for further specialized care.

Viral conjunctivitis: It presents with painless watery eye discharge, there may be
photophobia if the cornea is involved. The disease is bilateral though it may be asymmetrical. If
adenovirus is the cause, it appears in epidemics so there will be history of being in contact with
patients with similar eye condition. Patients present with haemorrhages of conjunctival vessels.
It is usually self-limiting. Apply antibiotic eye ointment or eye drops if there is secondary
infection with other organisms

198 | P a g e
  Note:
  Viral Conjunctivitis is very contagious so patients and members of the family should be
  alerted

Bacterial conjunctivitis: Presents with acute onset of painless purulent discharge. The
conjunctiva shows a velvety beef red appearance. Sometimes there is ocular discomfort and it
is usually bilateral. The diagnosis is mainly clinicallyl. Bacterial conjunctivitis patients who are
not responding to treatment should have eye swabs for Gram stain and for culture and
sensitivity to tailor down treatment. Bacterial Conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotic eye drops
three hourly. If no improvement after two days refer to eye specialist.

Ophthalmia Neonatorum/Neonatal Conjunctivitis; This is a special type of acute bacterial
infection of the eyes that affect newborn baby during the first 28 days of life. Causative
organisms are Neisseria gonorrhoea, Chlamydia trachomatis and Staphylococcus spp. The
infection is acquired from mother's birth canal secretions.

Diagnosis: Patients present with massive oedema and redness of eyelids and with purulent
and copious discharge from the eyes. There is usually rapid ulceration and perforation of
corneal which eventually leads to blindness if treatment is delayed. It usually presents 3 to 4
days of life. Late presentation may also appear depending on the causative organism.
For Prevention and treatment see the "Neonatal Conjuctivitis (NC) Flow chart under the Sexual
Trasmmited disease Chapter

3.0 SQUINT

A squint means that the eyes are looking in different directions; one eye appears to be turned
in or out. It may occur in children or adults. There are many causes of squint but the most
important and common ones in children are refractive errors, amblyopia (lazy eye),
retinoblastoma, cataract and syndromic eye diseases that may be of neurologic origin or not. In
additional to that, in adults squint may be complication of diabetes mellitus and orbital/head
trauma.

199 | P a g e
Treatment
Treatment of squint depends on the aetiology. Thorough examination of the eyes by a pediatric
eye specialist is needed to guide the management of the patients, so refer all children to
Paediatric Eye Tertiary Centre.

4.0 OCULAR SURFACE DISEASE

The most common ocular surface diseases are pterygium and Squamous cell carcinoma of the
conjunctiva. These affect the exposed area of conjunctiva as a response to chronic dryness and
exposure to sunlight.

4.1 Pterygium

This is a triangular sheet of fibrovascular tissue which invades the cornea. Patients present
with adherent conjunctival overgrowth on the cornea.

Treatment
Treatment for pterygium is surgical excision in advanced stage where the visual axis is involved.
The favoured method is excision that is followed by a free conjunctival graft. Surgery should be
done by qualified eye care personnel and antibiotic steroid combination drops should be given
postoperative.

4.2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma

This is the most common tumor of the conjunctiva. It is a slow growing tumour which invades
the sclera and cornea. It can penetrate the globe in advanced stages. It occurs in increased
frequency in patients with Xeroderma Pigmentosum and is one of the ocular manifestations of
HIV.

Diagnosis
The tumour is seen as papillary or gelatinous mass associated with feeder vessels. It is located
at the limbus and may involve adjacent cornea.

Treatment
If tumour is suspected,

     Excise the mass with wider margin (2 mm)
     Treat the margins with Mitomycin C, 5 Fluorouracil or cryotherapy
     Send the specimen for histological examination
     For advanced tumours where the globe has been infiltrated, removal of the eye is

         indicated (Enucleation or exenteration)
     Send patients with confirmed diagnosis to Oncologist for radiotherapy

4.3 Retinoblastoma

It is the commonest childhood malignant tumor of the eyes. It is diagnosed between the first 1
to 3years of life.

Diagnosis

200 | P a g e
  The most common initial sign is white pupil reflex (leokocoria), followed by squint, and
  rarelyvitreous haemorraghe, hyphema, ocular/periocular inflammation, glaucoma and in late
  stagesproptosis and hypopyon. It can be inherited so examine the child and sibs in hereditary
  for every 4 months until yr 4, then 6 monthly until yr 6 and yearly in over 8yrs.
  Management
The goals of treatments are:-

        To save the patients life
        To savage the patients eye and vision if possible
Choice of treatment depends on Size of tumor, Location and Extent of the tumour.
Treatment is done in Specialized Centres by both Ophthalmologist and Pediatric Oncologist
(Detail in treatment refer to oncology chapter)
Treatment Modalities
   Enucleation of the affected eye and the eye is taken for histology
   Chemotherapy
   External beam radiotherapy
   Plaque radiotherapy
   Cryotherapy and laser photoablation
      NOTE:
      Monitoring is very important due to the following:-

            There is a chance of developing retinoblastoma in the fellow eye.
            The risk is diminished in increase in age
            Also watch for secondary tumors like osteosarcoma

            NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE CONDITIONS

1.0 INFECTIONS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

Infections of the nervous system can arise secondary to bacteria, fungi, protozoa or viruses.
Clinical features will depend on the site of the nervous system involved.

1.1 Bacterial infections

1.1.1 Meningitis
The major features of the disease is Inflammation of the layers (meninges) covering the brain
and spinal cord

Diagnosis
      Headache, high fever, chills, backache, nausea and vomiting
      Neck stiffness, convulsions and coma may occur.

Children
In infants under 1 year diagnosis is much more difficult therefore always think of it in a sick
child if:

          Refusal to eat and or suckle, drowsiness and weak cry
          Focal or generalized convulsions
          Fever may be absent
          Irritability
          Hypotonia, neck is often not stiff
          Bulging fontanelle

           NOTE: A lumbar puncture is essential to confirm diagnosis

General management
     Control of fever and pain with Paracetamol
     If unconscious, insert NGT for feeding and urethral catheter

premature/low-birth weight infants

1.1.2 Tetanus
It is an acute, often fatal disease caused by an exotoxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium
Clostridium tetani. It is acquired through wounds contaminated with spores of the bacteria and
in the case of neonates, through the umbilical stump, resulting in neaonatal tetanus.

Diagnosis
     Generalized spasms and rigidity of skeletal muscles
     Patients are usually fully conscious and aware.

General management
    Nurse in dark, quiet room to avoid unnecessary external stimuli which can trigger spasms
    Protect the airway (patient may need to be referred)
    Immediate (preferably after administration of antitetanus immunoglobulin) thorough
        cleaning of the site of entry (wound/umbilicus), leaving it exposed without dressing
    Pain management with paracetamol (via NGT) as the spasms can be very painful
    Maintenance of fluid balance and nutrition (via NGT)
    Avoid giving medications via IV/IM route as injections can trigger spasms
    Sedation (see below) and care as for unconscious patient
    Prevention:
                   B: Tetanus (toxoid) vaccine 0.5 ml IM; repeat after 4 weeks and after 6-12
         months, then boost every 10 years thereafter

Treatment

1.1.3 Brain abscess
Brain abscess is a focal collection of pus/ necrotic tissue within the brain parenchyma, which
can arise as a complication of a variety of infections, trauma or surgery. The manifestations of
brain abscess initially tend to be nonspecific, resulting in a delay in establishing the diagnosis.

Diagnosis
     Headache is the most common symptom, neck stiffness, lethargy progressing to coma,
         vomiting, and focal neurologic deficit.

General management
     Control of fever and pain with Paracetamol
     If unconscious, insert NGT for feeding and urethral catheter

                100 mg/kg/day)

            Note: Where the patient is allergic to penicillin, chloramphenicol 500 mg
            every 6 hours can be used instead

1.2 Fungal infections

Cryptococcal meningitis
It develops in patients who are immunocompromised e.g. HIV-positive patients with low CD4
cell count.

Diagnosis
     Headache, fever, intolerance to light and sound, neck stiffness, vomiting, seizures,
         deafness and blindness
     In advanced stages it may present with confusion, altered consciousness and coma.

General management

Refer to section on bacterial meningitis

Treatment
                   B: Fluconazole 400-800mg (12-15mg/kg/day in children) IV or (O)
                   depending on the patient's condition for 6-10 weeks, then 200mg for the rest of

        the patient's life
                                       OR

                   D:Amphotericin B0.7-1 mg/kg/day by slow infusion IV for 2 weeks
                                       Plus

                   S: Flucytosine2-5mg/kg IV four times daily for 14 days.
                    Followed by maintenance treatment with Fluconazole 200mg for life

Patients started on IV should be switched to oral therapy as soon as patients are clinically
stable to reduce the length of hospitalization and lower associated costs.Consider LP as
diagnostic and theurapeutic tool for cryptococal meningitis. Cryptococcal antigen test should be
done as there are cases of negative Indian ink results with cryptococcal meningitis.

1.3 Protozoal infections

Toxoplasmosis
Immunocompetent persons with primary infection are usually asymptomatic, but latent infection
can persist for the life of the host. In immunosuppressed patients, especially patients with
AIDS, the parasite can reactivate and cause disease, usually when the CD4 lymphocyte count
falls below 100 cells/mm3.

Diagnosis
     Patients can present with focal paralysis or motor weakness depending on the brain area
         affected
     Neuro-psychiatric manifestations corresponding to the affected area in the brain,
         seizures or altered mental status.

Note: Diagnosis is predominantly based on clinical findings after exclusion of other common
causes of neurological deficit. If available, a CT scan is very useful for confirmation. Toxoplasma
serology has to be done for addition in diagnosis.

General management
Similar to bacterial meningitis

Prophylaxis
         Primary prophylaxis therapy
                   A: Trimethoprim­Sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 160/800mg orally/day.

Treatment
Acute infection

                   A: Trimethoprim­Sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 120mg/kg daily in 2-4 divided
                   dose for 21 days

                   C: Sulphadiazine 1 gm every 6 hours for 6 weeks

                                       Plus

                   C: Pyrimethamine 100mg loading dose then 50mg /day for 6 weeks

                   C: Folinic acid tabs 10mg /day for 6 weeks.

                   After six weeks of treatment give prophylaxis therapy with Sulphadiazine tabs
                   500mg 6 hourly + Pyrimethamine tabs 25-50mg /day + Folinic acid tabs 10mg
                   /day.

For those allergic to sulphur replace Sulphadiazine tabs with

                   S: Clindamycin capsules 450mg 6 hourly.

207 | P a g e
                   Discontinue maintenance therapy when CD4 count is >200 cells/mm3, initial
         therapy is completed and patient is asymptomatic.

In case of seizures, Refer to Tanzania National Guidelines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS for
further details

1.4 Viral infections

In Tanzania, viral infection of the nervous system is mainly caused by Herpes simplex virus and
HIV.
See section on viral infections and HIV

1.4.1 Rabies
Rabies is an acute viral infection of the central nervous system that affects all mammals and is
transmitted to man by by animal bites via infected secretions, usually saliva.

Diagnosis
     Early or prodromal clinical features of the disease include apprehensiveness, restlessness,
         fever, malaise and headache
     The late features of the disease are excessive motor activity and agitation, confusion,
         hallucinations, excessive salivation, convulsions and hydrophobia

Note: Death is considered as invariable outcome.

         General management
          Local wound therapy -wash wound thoroughly with water and soap and repeat

              process with 10% Povidone iodine to prevent secondary bacterial infection

Prophylactic wound therapy that has lasted less than 8 hours

          Tetanus toxoid vaccine see section on Tetanus

208 | P a g e
1.4.2 Herpes simplex encephalitis
The majority of cases in adults caused by HSV-1, a small number are caused by HSV-2 usually
in immuno-suppression or in neonates. It causes inflammation and necrosis in the brain.

Diagnosis
     Early features are fever, headache & altered consciousness which may develop gradually
         over days or rapidly over hours
     The most common manifestations are personality change, dysphasia, behavioural
         disturbance and occasional psychotic features
     Focal or generalized seizures can occur
     On lumbar puncture, CSF is under increased pressure and may appear normal or show a
         mild-moderate lymphocytosis, a mild-moderate increase in protein and normal or mildly
         decreased glucose.

Note: The disease is easily missed in Tanzanian settings due to lack of diagnostic facilities and
should therefore be suspected in patients not responding to antibiotics/other treatment.

General Management
Manage it as for unconscious patients (Control seizures)
Treatment

                   B: Acyclovir 10­15 mg/kg (O) every 8 hours for 14­21 days

                   dose 60mg

2.0 MENTAL CONDITIONS

2.1 Anxiety conditions

It is a group of disorders characterized by a chronic, unrealistic/exaggerated anxiety often
punctuated by acute attacks of anxiety or pain. It afflicts 5% of the population and is
characteristically a disorder of young adults and affects women twice as often as men. The
illness may take many forms. Acute anxiety attacks are characterized by sudden onset of
tension, restlessness, tremors, breathlessness, tachycardia and palpitations. Chronic anxiety
state presents with persistent diffuse anxiety, motor tension, autonomic hyperactivity,
unpleasant anticipation and irritability.

Diagnosis
Refer to ICD ­ 10 criteria

General management
     Medicines do not resolve the causes of the illness but may reduce anxiety.
     Education about the nature of anxiety
     Psychotherapy ­ Training in strategies for controlling anxiety and reducing
         stress

209 | P a g e
Treatment

           C: Diazepam 5 ­ 10 mg (O) every 8 hours

                              OR

           D: Lorazepam 1 ­ 4mg daily in divided doses

Referral
If symptoms persist for longer than 3 months despite above measures refer the patient to the
specialists

2.2 Panic disorder

It is characterized by recurrent and sometimes unpredictable attacks of anxiety or panic.
Common symptoms include palpitations, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath,
feeling of choking, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, and derealization; fear of losing control, fear
of dying, parasthesias, and chills.

Diagnosis
Diagnosed after recurrent (several) panic attacks within a one month period.

General management
     Psycho-education and reassurance.
     Psychotherapy, e.g. cognitive-behaviour therapy.
     Always consider the possibility of an underlying medical condition, e.g. thyrotoxicosis,
         etc.

Treatment
The initial aim is to control the panic symptoms and exclude an underlying medical cause. Give
the patient Benzodiazepines, repeated as necessary to control symptoms, e.g. Diazepam,
IV/oral, 5mg daily. Increase to 10 ­ 15mg daily in divided doses
Note: Do not give the therapy more than two weeks

Referral
If panic disorder is diagnosed, long-term treatment may be required therefore refer the patient
to the mental clinic. Most patients can be treated as outpatients, but some may need to be
admitted.
Treatment of choice

                   D: Fluoxetine oral 20 mg once a dayfor 6 months­1 year

                   Extended drug treatment over many years and even life-long may be necessary,
                   except where cognitive-behaviour therapy has been successful.Relapses may
                   occur when treatment is discontinued.

210 | P a g e
2.3 Major depressive disorder

It is a mood disorder characterised by at least 2 weeks of depressed mood as well as
diminished interest and pleasure in activities and is associated with:

     Somatic symptoms, e.g. change in appetite and sleep, agitation or retardation and loss
         of energy

     Psychic symptoms, e.g. feeling of worthlessness, guilt, diminished concentration or
         indecisiveness, thoughts of death and suicide

2.4 Bipolar disorder

It is a lifelong illness, which may have an episodic, variable course. The presenting episode may
be manic, hypomanic, depressive or mixed. By definition, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder
requires either a current or previous episode of mania. An episode of mania is typically
characterised by an elevated mood whereby a patient may experience extreme happiness which
might also be associated with an underlying irritability. Such mood may be associated with
increased energy/activity, talkativeness and a reduction in the need for sleep and features may
be accompanied by grandiose and/or religiose delusions. Bipolar disorder causes substantial
psychosocial morbidity, frequently affecting patients' relationships within the family as well as
their occupation and other aspects of their lives.

Diagnosis
Refer to ICD ­ 10 criteria

General management
     Hospitalisation may be required during acute mania.
     Psychotherapy, usually after the manic episode has been controlled with medication.
     Family therapy and psycho-education of patient and family to increase compliance and
         knowledge of the condition.
     In severe cases, psychiatrist directed electroconvulsive therapy may be required.

Treatment for Manic or Mixed Episodes
For agitated and acutely disturbed patient:

                   C: Haloperidol injection IM, 5 mg half hourly for 2 hours to a maximum of

                   oral once containment is achieved.

Maintenance therapy
Under specific circumstances such as past or family history of response and rapid cycling, i.e.
moving between mood states: Give

                   C: Sodium valproate 20 mg/kg/day (O) in 2­3 divided doses
                                       OR

2.7 Epilepsies

Are disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) which are characterized by chronic
spontaneous recurring seizures
Management

          Make sure that all other causes (alcohol, eclampsia, meningitis, hypoglycaemia etc)
              are excluded

          Patients with more than one fit should be considered for treatment
          Treatment should be started with phenobarbitone alone. Full effect can be

              experienced usually after two weeks.
          Phenobarbitone can be increased to maximum if seizures persist (refer to a table

              below)
          When no improvement is obtained change to phenytoin, tapering phenobarbitone by

              reducing the dose by 30 mg every week. If seizures persist, increase phenytoin by
              50 mg increment to a maximum dose of 600 mg daily
          If no appreciable improvement, change to carbamazepine, stopping phenytoin by
              reducing dose by 50 mg per week. Increase the dose to maximum
          If possible the combination of these drugs should be avoided

215 | P a g e
 Patients still having seizures despite of having the above drugs should be referred to
    a higher level of treatment.

    Note: Phenytoin has a lot of side effects therefore prefer Carbamazepine if available

    III. Alcohol Dependence Syndrome
Alcoholism is a syndrome consisting of two phases: problem drinking and alcohol addiction.
Problem-drinking is the repetitive use of alcohol, often to alleviate tension or solve other
emotional problems. Alcohol addiction is a true addiction similar to that which occurs following
the repeated use of barbiturates or similar drugs.

Diagnosis

219 | P a g e
b) Delirium Tremens (DT)
It is an acute episode of delirium that is usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol. Although
the typical delirium occurs 2­3 days following cessation of prolonged alcohol intake, reaching a
peak at around 5 days, some withdrawal symptoms such as tremor may start within 12 hours.

Diagnosis
     Predominantly visual hallucinations
     Disorientation
     Agitation
     Tachycardia
     Hypertension
     A low-grade fever may be present
     Withdrawal tonic-clonic seizures may occur between24 and 48 hours following cessation
         of alcohol intake

Note: It is important to consider alternative causes, when making the diagnosis. This is
especially true for cases with an atypical presentation.

General measures
     Secure airway
     Ensure Breathing
     Circulation
         Give IV fluid (Dextrose Normal Saline) to prevent hypoglycaemia and hypotension

    IV. Dementia
It is a progressive loss of cognitive function usually of insidious onset. Initial presentation may
be with mild personality or memory changes, before more pronounced defects become more
evident. Patients need to be investigated for treatable (reversible) systemic, neurological and
psychiatric illnesses. Transient worsening of condition may be due to metabolic disorders,
infections and drug side effects.

General management
     Appropriate care and support, according to level of impairment.

   METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE DISEASE CONDITIONS

1.0 Diabetes Mellitus

Diabetes mellitus is a clinical syndrome characterized by hyperglycemia (persistently higher
blood glucose values than the normal range) due to deficiency or diminished effectiveness of
insulin. There are three main types of diabetes:

     Type 1 diabetes (T1DM): results from the body's failure to produce insulin and

         requires the person to inject insulin [insulin-dependentdiabetes mellitus (IDDM)].

     Type 2 diabetes (T2DM): results from insulin resistance, a condition in which cells fail

         to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute insulin deficiency.

         [(Formerly referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)].

     Gestational diabetes: is when a pregnant woman, who has never had diabetes, has a

         high blood glucose level during pregnancy. It may precede development of T2DM.

Diagnosis
     Main clinical features of diabetes are thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, tiredness, loss of
         weight, blurring of vision, white marks on clothing, pruritus vulvae, balanitis,
         paraesthesia or pain in the limbs and recurrent bacterial infection
     Fasting plasma glucose level  7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)
     Plasma glucose  11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load as
         in a glucose tolerance test
     Symptoms of hyperglycemia and casual plasma glucose  11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)
     Glycosyated hemoglobin (Hb A1C)  6.5%.

Non pharmacological Management
     Healthy lifestyles
              o Encourage weight loss if the patient is obese or has body mass index (BMI) of
                   more than 25
              o Reduce intake of fatty foods
              o Avoid the intake of refined sugar
              o Increase in fibers intake > 15g/100kcal (traditional African dieties are rich in
                   fibers)
              o Increase physical activeness levels e.g. brisk walking 30 minutes at least three
                   times a week
              o Encourage reduction and stoppage of alcohol intake
              o Encourage to stop smoking

Note: Regular ongoing blood glucose level monitoring is recommended

Diabetic Diet
Ideally a dietician should calculate dietary requirements for individual patient. The aim of diet
control is to reduce the blood sugar to normal and maintain a constant blood sugar level. 45-

222 | P a g e
50% of energy intake should be in the form of carbohydrates. Complex carbohydrates are
preferable to simple sugars. Carbohydrates and calories should be evenly distributed through
the day. Meals must not be missed. An insulin dependent diabetic may have snack between
meals. Sugar and sugar-containing food/drinks should be avoided. It is only recommended
when a patient feels faint, or ill and cannot eat normally. It is also recommended that, for
diabetics a snack should be taken before and after playing sport.

Treatment with Oral Hypoglycemic
If dietary control on its own fails or the blood glucose levels are persistently high initiate

                  C: Glibenclamide 2.5- 15mg (O) once daily for non obese patients
                                                 OR

                  C: Metformin 500-2000mg (O) in 2-3 divided doses with or after meals for obese
                   patients.

Review the blood glucose at diabetic clinic and adjust medicines as needed until blood glucose
is controlled.
Alternatively

                   C: Chlorpropamide 125-500mg (O) 1-2 divided doses
                                                 OR

                   D: Gliclazide 40-320mg (O) in 2 divided doses
                                                 OR

                   D: Glipizide 2.5 ­ 5mg (O) daily shortly before breakfast or lunch, adjust
                   according to response; maximum 20mg daily; up to 15mg may be given as a
                   single dose).

Note  The lower dosage are appropriate when initiating treatment in elderly
      patients with uncertain meals schedules, or in patients with mild
      hyperglycemia
      Activity of sulphonylurea is prolonged in both hepatic and renal failure
      Sulphonylurea are best taken 15 to 30 minutes before meals
      Chlorpropamide should not used in elderly since it has long half life

Treatment with Insulin Injection
Treatment with insulin injection is indicated in Type I Diabetes Mellitus or in uncontrolled Type
II Diabetes Mellitus, Hyperglycemic emergencies, Pancreatitis, Pregnancy and trauma or
Surgery.

For T1DM use insulin such as ultra short, short, intermediate, long acting and mixed insulin.
The dose of insulin is 0.5 to 0.7Unit/kg/day as initial dose; adjust accordingly (Increase or
decrease) depending on the response

For the poorly controlled T2DM, use 0.5unit/kg/day as initial dose; adjust accordingly (Increase
or decrease) depending on the response

223 | P a g e
Note  One unit of insulin covers 10-15 grams of carbohydrates
      It is recommended that short acting insulin should be withdrawn first then intermediate
      insulin
      Insulin injection is given immediately after loading the syringe

2.0 HYPOGLYCAEMIA

Hypoglycaemia is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes

Symptoms: Hunger, sweating, anxiety, palpitation,  headache,  confusion,  convulsions,
weakness and coma
Commonest causes;

     Doing more exercise than normal
     Omission or delay of snacks or main meal
     Insulin overdose
     Eating insufficient carbohydrate
     Overuse of alcohol
     Overdosage of sulphonylurea

Test: Blood sugar< 3.0 mmol/L

Management
For conscious patients
Quickly take a glass of a sugary rich drink or eat one table spoon of sugar or honey and have a
meal. If symptoms persist after 5 minutes repeat the above.

For unconscious patient, give:
          IV 50% glucose bolus (40 ­ 50mls) or 100 ­ 150 mls of 20% dextrose followed by 8
              ­ 10 % glucose if necessary
          If Glucagon injection available administered 1mg IM or SC
          On recovery give long acting carbohydrate snack
          Prolonged IV dextrose infusion (5 ­ 10% for 12 - 24 hrs) may be necessary if
              hypoglyceamia is a result of long acting suphonylureas/ long and intermediate acting
              insulin or alcohol
          If IV access is impossible, consider nasogastric tube or rectal glucose or if available
              glucagon 1mg IM
          On recovery, attempt if you can identify the cause of hypoglycaemia and correct it
          Asses the type o f insulin used, injection site (Lipohypertrophy can alter the rate of
              absorption) and injection techniques

          CAUTION Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a medical emergency. All patients
         should be admitted in Intensive care unit (ICU), kept under care of registrar or
         consultant.

Investigation: Timely diagnosis is crucial
     Check blood glucose
     Urine for ketones
     Arterial blood pressure
     Urea, creatinine, and electrolyte
     Use DKA chart to guide treatment and monitor the patient

Management
     Admit to ICU

     Insert Naso gastric tube for feeding
     Fluid and electrolytes replacement
                             A: 1 Litre of NS + 2g KCL (when available) hourly
                                                 OR
                             A: 1 Litre of Ringer's Solution (when KCL is not available)
              o When blood glucose falls to 14 mmol/L or bellow START 5% Dextrose 500mls
                   4hrly (1000mls 8 hourly)
              o Isotonic dextrose saline may be used in place of dextrose 5%
              o If a patient still dehydrated Continue Normal saline or Ringer's solution as well.

 Insulin Therapy
                        C: Soluble insulin 8 Units IM and 8 Units IV at a time. Then give 8 Units

              IM soluble insulin bolus hourly
         o When blood glucose falls to 14 mmol/L or bellow give soluble Insulin 4Units S.C.

              4 hourly OR IM 2 hourly and continue until the patient is able to eat again then
              change to B.D. or T.I.D Insulin

227 | P a g e
Monitoring
     Assess CVS for volume overload (Input output chart, oedema (lungs, peripheral)
     Check blood glucose 2hrly if using I.M. route or 4 hrly if S.C. route.

4.0 NON-KETOTIC HYPEROSMOLAR STATE (NKHS)

Most common elderly in T2DM

Symptoms
     Polyuria,
     Ortostatic hypotension
     Altered mental state Lethargy, obtundation, seizures, possible coma
     Weight loss
     Diminished oral intake of fluids
     Mental confusion
     Profound dehydration
     Lethargy or comatous
     Tachycardia
     Hypotension
     Differentiated from DKA (No nausea and vomiting, no abdominal pain, and Kussmaul
         breathing)

Note: Try to identify precipitating factors;
     Poor oral fluid intake
     MI, stroke, sepsis, pneumonia, and other serious infection must be sought
     Drugs: Thiazides diuretic, glucocorticoids, phenytoin

Laboratory investigation and diagnosis:
     Check blood glucose (May be > 55.5mmol/L (1000mg/dl)
     Check electrolytes (K+, Na+, Cl-)
     Check Renal function ( Urea and Creatinine)
     Check osmolarity (usually >330 mosmol/L)
     Serum osmolarity = 2(Na++ K+) + glucose + Urea (Glucose and Urea in mmol/L)
         (Normal is < 310 as calculated)
     For Hyperosmolar Non Ketotic Coma (HNC/HONC) osmolarity is usually over
         330mosmol/L

Note: A patient may be acidotic due to lactic acidosis or shock/sepsis
     In this case principle management as in case of DKA
              o IV fluids should be replaced as half-normal saline (0.45%) if hypernatremia,
              o Normal saline if serum sodium is normal
     There is a frequent intercurrent illness usually sepsis, CVA, or cardiac and these must be
         diagnosed and treated. PROPHYLACTIC HEPARIN MAY BE USED (Monitor bleeding
         indices-PT, PTT, platelets count).

5.0 DIABETES AND OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES

Diabetic patients are 2 ­ 4 times likely to develop cardiovascular disease than people without,
due to two major processes: Atherosclerosis and hypertension. The clinical spectrum of
cardiovascular diseases is:

228 | P a g e
     Coronary heart disease:
               Angina (which may be silent)
               Acute coronary artery syndrome
               Congestive cardiac failure
               Sudden death

     Cerebral vascular accident;
          Stroke
          Transient ischaemic Attacks
          Dementia

     Peripheral vascular diseases
          Intermittent claudication
          Foot ulcer
          Gangrene

Assessment
     Do annual assessment
     Refer to secondary and tertiary health institution
     Evaluation will include; ECG, Chest X-Ray, if with symptoms/signs of heart failure need
         echocardiogram, stress test, coronary angiography, and carotid Doppler in case of
         cerebral vascular diseases
     Peripheral vascular disease evaluationinclude Doppler and angiography of lower limbs.

Treatment
     Initiate aspirin

Use of Aspirin in Type 2 DM reduces risk of cardiovascular events. It is indicated for secondary
prevention for coronary and cerebrovascular diseases; primary prevention for people with Type
2 DM over the age of 40years having: Family history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cigarette
smooking, obesity, proteinuria and dyslipidemia

                   C: Soluble Aspirin 75 ­ 150 mg
Note: Aspirin is contraindication in peptic/duodenal ulcer, dyspepsia, hurt burn. Malignant
hypertension, haemorrhagic storke. Consider beta-blockers, ACE inhibitor, angitensin receptor
blocker (ARBs) and tight glycemic control.

            Caution: The patient should be monitored in the cardiac clinic

6.0 GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is any degree of glucose intolerance first recognized in
pregnancy.

Screening
Perform screening for GDM between 24 ­ 28 weeks of gestation. The most risk women are
those with: BMI > 25 kg/M2; Previous history of GDM; Glycosuria; Previous big baby; Poor
obstetric history; Family history of DM; Known impaired Glucose Tolerance/Impaired fasting
Glucose and Grand multipara

229 | P a g e
Management
Target Glycaemia; Preprandial blood glucose 3.5 ­ 5.5mmol/L and postprandial blood glucose
5 ­ 7.5mmol/L
A combined health-care team (Obstetrician, diabetologist or internist, diabetes educator,
pediatrician/neonatologist) is required.

7.0 SURGERY AND THE DIABETIC PATIENT
Correct pre-operative management depends on:

     Type of surgery: Major or minor
     Type 1 or Type 2 DM
     Recent diabetic control

         Note:
               Diabetic patient should be first on the operation list
               Minor surgery: does not involve general anesthesia or starvation
               Major Surgery: Involve a general anesthesia and therefore a period of fasting.

Type 1 DM and Surgery
     Once snack is missed it is better to start an I.V. regimen irrespective of the size of the
         procedure
     Maintain interrupted insulin administration (hourly) to prevent DKA
     Administer 5% dextrose in maintenance IV fluids to avoid lipolysis and ketoacidosis in
         patients with restricted oral intake.
     Blood glucose monitoring 1 -4 hourly (Aim reading 6 ­ 10 mmol/L)
     Measure electrolyte and urine for ketones hourly
     Patients using conventional therapy may be given a dose of intermediate-acting
         Insulin(at least half of the usual dose)
     Hyperglycema may be managed with regular insulin, given 4 -6 hrs and continued until
         oral intake is resumed. Mixed insulin may be given
     Patients receiving MDIT (Multiple Daily Insulin Therapy) should receive preoperative
         basal insulin dose without interruption in the perioperative period. When oral intake is
         restricted, regular Insulin may be given 4-6hrs to control hyperglycemia. When a diet is
         tolerated, the MDIT regimen should be resumed
     Post operatively ­give IV 1 Litre of 5 ­ 10% dextrose + 20mlKCl + 2/3 of total daily
         dose of Insulin over 8Hrs and repeat until able to take orally
     Check Na+ levels (Caution-Hyponatraemia)

NOTE: Insulin Infusion Pump
An intravenous infusion pump is essential in the management of DKA, major illness or major
surgery in the patient with DM. The advantages are: 1. Ability to tightly control the blood
glucose levels. 2. Separation of Insulin and fluid regimen. Use 50Units of short acting insulin in
50mls of normal saline (0.9%). (Thus unit/hr=ml/hr)

Check blood glucose hourly initially and 2hourly when stable. Continue I.V regimen until patient
is taking normal diet postoperatively. Calculate s.c. dose from i.v insulin requirement in previous
24 hours. The first dose of s.c. insulin is given thirty minutes (unless a short-acting analogue)
prior to stopping the I.V. insulin infusion. The patient then eats a normal diet.

T2DM and Surgery
Preoperatively
Delay surgery if possible if glycaemic control is poor;

     HbA1C >9%
     FBG >10mmol/L
     RBG >13mmol/L
Note: Optimize the glycaemic control if Surgery is elective. Screen for complication that may
affect surgical risk: Nephropathy, cardiac disease, proliferative retinopathy. Inform surgical
team of the complication.

231 | P a g e
If on diet and/or oral antidiabetics and well controlled and surgery is minor:
     Omit dose on the mornig of surgery
     Resume therapy when eating normally

If on insulin therapy or poor glycaemic control or major surgery;
     Use continuos IV insulin infusion
     Monitor blood glucose before, during and after surgery.
     Target blood glucose levels 6 ­ 10mmol/L

For Major surgery (glucose-insulin Potassium Regimen)
     Add 16 Units of short acting Insilin and 10mmol/L KCl to 500mls of 10% dextrose.
              o Infuse at 80ml/hr IV using volumetric pump (infusion pump)
     If obese or Initial blood glucose is high consider higher dose (20Units)
     If very thin or usual insulin dose is very low consider lower dose (12Units)
     Monitor blood glucose levels hourly
              o If blood glucose is low or falling reduce dose by 4 Units
              o If blood glucose is high or raising increase dose by 4 Units
     Continue the infusion until 60minutes after the first meal.
     Resume usual therapy after first meal
     Check daily electrolytes (Caution- Dilution hyponatremia)

 Fluid calculation
-- Requirements = DEFICIT + MAINTENANCE
-- Calculate DEFICIT = estimated % dehydration x body weight (kg)

         o Assume weight loss is 10% for all children in DKA

236 | P a g e
-- Calculate MAINTENANCE
-- Then add DEFICIT to 48 HOURS MAINTENANCE and replace this volume evenly over 48

    hours as Normal Saline 0.9% initially (OR a balanced salt solution such as
    Ringer's lactate or acetate).

Example: A 6 year old 20kg boy who is 10% dehydrated has already been given 20ml/kg to

improve his circulation now requires ­

               - 10/100 (10%) x 20kg = 2kg

               - ie. 1kg=1000mls: therefore 2kg= 2000mls DEFICIT

               - 60ml x 20kg = 1200ml as MAINTENANCE each 24 hours

               - Deficit + Maintenance

2000+2400= 4400ml over 48 hours = 91ml/hour

NB: This calculation will usually cover ongoing urinary losses which in most cases do not need
additional replacement but excessive continuing fluid losses such as severe vomiting might need
replacing if the severity of dehydration is not improving.

   Insulin Dilutions
A solution of Soluble Insulin 1 unit / ml made up in Normal Saline. Dilute 50 units soluble
(regular) insulin in 50ml normal saline-1unit=1ml)
When syringe pumps are not available a separate low dose insulin infusion [Soluble Insulin 50

units in Normal Saline 500ml (ie 1 unit Insulin per 10ml Saline)] may be given at a rate of 0.1

units/kg/hour (this is in addition to the Saline infusion).

[The bag or bottle should be changed every 24 hours to avoid inactivation of insulin]

-- If BG rises again above 15mmol/l., increase the insulin infusion by 25%
-- If BG falls to < 8 mmol/l or falls too rapidly, change the infusion to Glucose 10% ( or more

    if necessary ) and add normal saline 75 mmol per litre.

Monitoring
237 | P a g e
Note: After resuscitation the rate of fall of BG should not be more than 4 ­5 mmol / hour
Do not stop insulin infusion or decrease below 0.05 units/kg/hour because a
continuous supply of both insulin and glucose substrate is needed to promote
anabolism and reduce ketosis.

    Note: To prevent rebound hyperglycemia do not stop the IV insulin infusion until 60 minutes
    after the first subcutaneous injection of short or rapid acting insulin

Complications of DKA and its management
Cerebral oedema

-- Approximately 0.4-1% of children with DKA develop cerebral oedema with a high
    mortality/morbidity

-- Cerebral oedema most commonly occurs in the first 24 hours after starting rehydration
    when the general condition of the child might seem to be improving. Vigilant observations
    throughout the 24 hours must not diminish

-- In many cases warning signs/symptoms occur which should prompt the emergency
    administration of Mannitol

Warning signs/symptoms of cerebral edema
-- Headache
-- Slow heart rate
-- Change in neurological status ( restlessness, irritability, increased drowsiness, incontinence,

    specific neurological signs (eg. cranial nerve palsies )
-- Rising BP, decreased O2 saturation

Action

-- Exclude hypoglycemia
                   C: Mannitol 1 g/kg IV over 20 minutes. Repeat if there is no response in 30 ­ 60

    minutes
-- Halve rehydration infusion rate until clinical state has improved
-- Nurse with child's head elevated
-- Alert anesthetic and senior pediatric staff (if assisted ventilation is required maintain pCO2

    above 3.5 kPa)
-- Consider continuation of Mannitol infusion 0.25 g/kg/hour to prevent rebound increase in

    intracranial pressure (or repeat bolus doses every 4-6 hours)
-- Intracranial events other than edema may occur eg.haemorrhage, thrombosis, infarction
-- If Mannitol not available or no response to Mannitol try hypertonic saline (3%), 5-10 ml/kg

    over 30 minutes
 Hypoglycemia ­ avoid by careful monitoring and adjustment of glucose/insulin infusion

    rates.

 Hypokalaemia

         o Avoid by infusing sufficient KCl and monitoring of Potassiumlevels.

238 | P a g e
           o When oral intake is being established include fluids/foods rich in potassium (e.g.
               milk, fruits such as banana).

    Aspiration pneumonia ­

           o Avoid by nasogastric tube in vomiting child with impaired consciousness

    Other associationswith DKA

           o These require specific management e.g. continuing abdominal pain (due to liver

11.0 HYPOTHYROIDISM

It is a clinical state that results from a decreased production or secretion of thyroid hormone.

Primary Causes:
     Iodine deficiency
     Congenital
     Drugs; Iodine excess (contrasts media containing iodine), lithium, antithyroid drugs, p-
         aminosalisylic acid, interferon alfa and other cytokines, aminoglutethimide.
     Autoimmune disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), atrophic thyroiditis
     Inflitrative disorders: amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, scleroderma,
     Iatrogenic (unknown) cause Iodine 131 treatment, total thyroidectomy, radiation
         treatment

Secondary Causes:
     Hypopituitarism: tumour, pituitary surgery, Sheehan's syndrome, trauma, genetic
         pituitary hormones deficiencies.
     Autoimmune hypothyroidism: May be associated with goitre (Hashimoto's or goitrous
         thyroiditis) or at minimal residual thyroid tissue (Atrophic thyroiditis)

Symptoms/Signs
Tiredness, Weakness, dry coarse skin, feeling cold, difficult in concentration and poor memory,
constipation, weight gain with poor appetite, dyspnoea and hoarseness of voice, menorrhagea
(late oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), paresthesias, impaired hearing. Others are cool
peripheral extremities, puffy face, hands and feet (Myxedema), diffused alopecia (hair loss),
bradycardia, peripheral odema, delayed tendon reflex relaxation, carpal tunnel syndrome and
serous cavity effusions.

Treatment
Target is to maintain normal TSH levels

                   D: Levothyroxine 1.5µg/kg. Maximum dose 100 -150µg daily.
In case of Hypothyroidism after Treatment of Grave disease:

                   D: Levothyroxine 75µg to 125µg/day

Note: Measure TSH after 2 months of Levothyroxine or if dose change

240 | P a g e
     Symptoms relief at 3 to 6 months ater normal TSH
     Follow up TSH at 2nd and 3rd year once TSH levels are normal
     For subclinical hypothyroidism: (Long treatment is avoided, Low dose of 25 t0 50 µg/day

         with goal to normalizing TSH)
     Women in reproductive period should be euthyroid before conceiving, as the

         hypothyroidism is associated with neural development. Dose may be doubled during
         pregnancy and returned to normal dose after delivery.

12.0 THYROTOXICOSIS

It is a state of excess thyroid hormone. Diseases of the thyroid gland are manifested by
qualitative or quantitative alterations in hormone secretion or enlargement of the thyroid gland
or both. Enlargement of the thyroid gland may result in normal increased, or decreased
hormone secretion.

Treatment
     Iodised salt may not provide sufficient iodine and should therefore not be prescribed
         alone
     Lugol's solution is too concentrated for daily use, and should be diluted by a factor of
         30 to give 4.2 mg/ml (Schiller's iodine).

Treatment Age less than 45 years
     First choice
                             B: Schiller's iodine 2 drops (460 micrograms) once daily for one year.
                             Response may be obtained within 6 months
     Second choice
                             B: Lugol's solution 3 drops (21mg) once each month for up to one
                             year.

Post thyroidectomy
     Iodine should be given daily indefinitely to prevent recurrence, following dosing
         schedule give above
     Physiological doses of iodine can be given even in pregnancy. It is actually necessary
         to provide the therapy to avoid iodine deficiency to the foetus
     Patients should continue taking iodized salt indefinitely (Ref. National Policy on Nutrition)
         after the completion of treatment or begin giving 1 drop (7mg) at Lugol's sol per month.
     All salts in Tanzania should be iodized (Government law)

13.0 HYPERTHYROIDISM

Hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) results from an excess of circulating thyroxine or liothyronine
or both. It is usually due to diffuse hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the thyroid gland (Graves'
disease). Hyperthyroidism is characterized by an increased metabolic rate, which causes weight
loss, increased appetite, fatigue, emotional disturbances, heat intolerance, sweating, muscle
weakness and diarrhea.

Treatment
Graves' disease:

241 | P a g e
                   C: Carbimazole 40mg (O) once daily for 3 weeks then 20mg daily for 3 weeks.
                   Maintenance dose 5mg for up to one year
Toxic Nodular Goitre
     Can be treated with antithyroid drugs and surgery or radio-iodine
                   C: Carbimazole 40mg (O) once daily for 3 weeks then 20mg daily for 3 weeks.
                   Maintenance dose 5mg for up to one year
CAUTION: Carbimazole may induce bone marrow suppression. Patients should be told to
report any type of infection. The drug should be stopped immediately if neutropenic. Check
iodine function at 5-6 weeks.

            HAEMATOLOGICAL DISEASE CONDITIONS

1.0 ANAEMIAS DUE TO RED CELL DISORDERS (NUTRITIONAL
DISORDERS)

1.1Iron deficiency anaemia

Clinical features: Clinical presentation in patient with iron deficiency anaemia includes fatigue,
palpitation, dizziness, koinlokia and pica. Iron deficiency is mainly due to blood loss secondary
to haemorrhage, malabsoption and hookworm infections.
Diagnostic criteria include Low MCV and MCH with microcytic/ hypochromic red cell.

Treatment guidelines
        General

          Treat the cause of blood loss, for example upper GI bleeding due to peptic ulcer and
              lower GI bleeding secondary to hookworm infections and malignancy.

          Oral Iron supplementation
          Blood transfusion is only indicated if it is life threatining.

         Iron deficiency anaemia

                   A: Ferrous sulphate200 mg (O) every 8 hours
                   Children5 mg/kg body weight every 8 hours.

         Continue for 3 months after the normal haemoglobin has been achieved.

1.2 Megaloblastic anemia

Clinical features of megaloblastic anaemia includes: fatigue, palpitation, numbness of lower
limbs, glossitis,Progressive neuropathy affecting peripheral sensory nerves and posterior and
lateral column and mildly jaundiced (Lemon yellow tint)

     Megaloblastic aneamias is due to inadequate intake, malabsorpsion due to Gastric
         causes: Pernicious anaemia, congenital lack or abnormality of intrinsic factor, Total or
         partial gastrectomy

     Treatment of megaloblastic anaemias include supplementation of folic acid and injection
         Vitamin B12

         Folic Acid deficiency
                   A: Folic acid 5 mg (O) once daily for a least 2 months

         Vitamin B 12 deficiency anaemia

243 | P a g e
                   C: Hydroxocobalamin 1 mg daily parenterally for one week and thereafter
                   1 mg every2-3 months for life if it's due to pernicious anaemia.

1.3 Haemolytic anaemias

Haemolytic anaemia are anaemias which result from an increase in the rate of red cell
destruction and this take place intravascular in some pathological disorders

Classification of haemolytic anaemia
I.Acquired haemolytic anaemias:
Immune:

               - Autoimmune (Warm antibody type, cold antibody)
               - Alloimmune:

      Clinical features
               The disease may occur at any age and sex
               Patient may present with symptom and features of Anaemia
               Symptoms are usually slow in onset however rapidly developing anaemia can
                   occur
               Splenomegaly is common but no always observed
               Jaundice

     Treatment

   i. Treat the underlying cause
  ii. Corticosteroids (prednisolone is the usual first line treatment 1mg/kg/day)
 iii. Splenectomy in those who fail to respond
 iv. Immunosuppressive drugs for the patients who fail to respond to corticosteroids and

         splenectomy.

244 | P a g e
                    S: Cyclosphophamide (60mg/m2) IV daily

  v. Folic acid is given to severe cases
 vi. Blood transfusion if anaemia is severe

 vii. Plasmapheresis

1.4 Sickle Cell Anaemia

Clinical features: Sickle cell disease is a spectrum of disorders resulting form inherited
haemoglobin S due to substitution of Valine for glutamic acid. In the homozygous state there
may be sickle cell anaemia. Onset of symptoms is usually after 6 months of life. Symptoms
may include anaemia, dactylitis, recurrent infections, impaired growth and development.

Crises
Three distinct types of crises develop in patients with sickle cell disease

     Vaso-occlusive or painful crises are more common occurring with a frequency from
         almost daily to yearly. It is important to distinguish between painful crises and pain
         caused by another process

     Aplastic crises occurs when erythropoiesis is suppressed
     Sequestration crises occurs in children or occasional in adult with an enlarged spleen due

         to massive pooling of red cells in the spleen

Treatment Guidelines
Nonspecific measures

                             A: Folic acid 5mg once daily

Specific measures
                             S: Hydroxyurea 15mg/kg/day. Maximum dose: 35mg/kg

Management of Complication
     Patients undergoing vascular crises should be kept warm and given adequate hydration
         and pain control (Inj pethedine 100mg 6hrly, Oral morphine 5mg/kg) and oxygen
     Acute chest syndrome is a life threatening complication and empiric antibiotics should be
         given.
     Stroke in children are the occurring complication, vigorous therapy is recommended (A
         regular transfusion program is recommended to reduced haemoglobin S, Exchange
         transfusion program is recommended)
     Priapism should be treate with exchange transfusion or possible surgical decompression.
     Bed rest, elevation and zinc sulphate dressings are should be used to treat leg ulcers
     A transfusion program or skin grafting can enhance healing

245 | P a g e
1.5 G6PD deficiency

Clinical features: G6PD is an inherited X-linkded recessive genetic disorder. Usually
asymptomatic but liable to haemolysis if incriminated drugs or foods are taken (e.g.
sulphonamides, fava beans, tabs chloroquine or proguanil).

Treatment Guidelines

 Avoid incriminated agents/foods or drugs
 Transfusion of packed red blood cells in severe anaemia. Give 10ml/kg body weight

    over a period of 8 hours. Then assess the level of haemoglobin.

1.6 Aplastic anaemia (Bone marrow failure)                                      marrow

Aplastic anaemia is defined as pancytopenia resulting from aplasia of the bone
Pancytopenia ­ a reduction in the blood count of all the major cell lines

     Autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and often associated with growth retardation
         and congenital defect of the skeleton

     Any of 8 gene mutations FANCA through FANCL are associated
     The majority of the patients have mutations of FANCA, C or G
     Marrow hypocellularity and pancytopenia may appear gradually after age 5yrs
     Abnormal skin pigmentation (café-au-lait spots)
     The underlying problem appear to be defective DNA repair

2.0 BLEEDING DISORDERS

2.1 Hereditary bleeding disorders

Hereditary bleeding disorders includes haemophilia A and B, Von Willebrand disease

2.1.1 Haemophilia
Haemophilia is an inherited, X-linked lifelong bleeding disorder which affects males almost
exclusively.

         Most frequent haemorrhage involves joints or muscles and bleeding parttens differ with
         age: Infants usually bleed into soft tissues ar from the mouth but as the boy grows,
         characterist joint bleeding becomes more common.

Haemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency)
     Is the most common of the hereditary clotting factor deficiencies and are caused by
         deficiency of factor VIII

247 | P a g e
     The inheritance is sex linked but up to 33% of patient have no family history and result
         from spontaneous mutation

Clinical presentation includes: spontaneous joint bleeding without injury, posttrauma
prolonged bleeding after injury, spontaneous muscle bleeding, retroperitoneal bleeding,
epistaxis and easy bruising. Complication includes arthropathy and disability.

Haemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency)
     Is due to deficiency of clotting factor IX

                     Precaution and Management of Haemophilia

                      Avoid I.M injections and use small gauge needles if necessary
                      Avoid use of aspirin, instead use paracetamol
                      Inform the patient and parents thoroughly on the problem, and provide

                          means of alerting other medical/pharmaceutical personnel
                      Genetic counselling

                      For haemarthrosis ­ AVOID incising or aspiration of the affected joint.
                          Treat by replacing the specific factor e.g factor 8 or 9 concentrate if
                          available or FFP (10ml/kg), joint support and tabs diclofenac for pain.

CLASSIFICATION OF HAEMOPHILIA
Haemophilia is classified as mild, moderate or severe according to the levels of circulating factor
VIII or IX and indicates the expected frequency of bleeding.

            CAUTION: All patients suspected with haemophilia A or B refer to the
            haemophilia treatment centre or consult haematology Unit

2.1.2 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD)
Von Willebrand Disease is inheritade disease due to deficiency of vW factor. Patients present
with a history of easy bruising, menorrhagea, gum bleeding and spontaneous joint bleeding in
severe form.

Treatment
                   D: Tranexamic acid 500mg (O) 8 hourly until bleeding is stoped.

    If no response
                   S: Desmopresin (DDVAP) infusion 0.3µg/kg IV. Max. dose 20µg.

    Note:Patient unresponsive to DDVAP may be treated with virus-inactivated vWF containing
    FVIII concentrate.

2.2 Acquired Bleeding Disorders/Platelet Disorders

2.2.1 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)
Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is caused by procoagulants that are introduced into or
produced in the blood and overcome the natural anticoagulant mechanisms. In the acute form
massive activation of coagulation does not allow time for compensatory increase in production
of coagulant and anticoagulant factors.

Clinical features are related to the underlying disorder leading to DIC. Patients present with
bleeding manifestation, extensive organ dysfunction, shock, renal corticle ischemia, coma,
delirium and focal neurological symptoms.

Treatment of the underlying disorder is of utmost importance including
            Antibiotics for infection
            Surgical debridement of necrotic tissues
            Chemotherapy for acute leukemia,
            Evacuation of dead fetus;
            Transfusion with platelets support for thrombocytopenia, fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
                for coagulation factor depletion and cryoprecipitate for hypofibrinogenemia.

 Multifactor deficiency, Liver disease gives Fresh Frozen Plasma 10-15mls/kg until bleeding is
stoped

          Monitor prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial
              thromboplstin (APTT), platelet count and fibrinogen.

250 | P a g e
        CAUTION: If patient is not bleeding Platelets concentrate is contraindicated. If
        DIC is severe enough to cause multiorgan dysfunction, management in an
        intensive care unit is required.

2.2.2 Idiopathic thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is an acquired disease of children and adults and defined
as isolated thrombocytopenia with no clinically apparent associated condition or other causes of
thrombocytopenia.The diagnosis relies on exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia.

Clinical feature for adult thrombocytopenia appears to be more common in young women than
in young men but amoung older patients, the sex incidence may be equal. Most adult patient
presents with a long history of purpura, menorrhagia, epistaxis and gingival haemorrhage.
Intracerebral haemorrhage occurs infrequently but is the most cause of death.

Note: A palpable spleen strongly suggests that ITP is not the cause for thrombocytopenia.

Treatment
Patients who are incidentally discovered to have asymptomatic mild or moderate ITP can safely
be followed with no treatment. Patients with platelet counts over 50,000/µl usually do not have
spontaneous bleeding and may undergo invasive procedure

Emergenct treatment of acute bleeding caused by severe thrombocytopenia
     Immediate platelet transfusion is indicated in patient with haemorrhagic emergencies
                             C: Prednisolone 1mg/kg/day orally
         IV immunoglobulin may be given as asingle dose infusion of 0.4-1.0g/kg followed
         immediately platelets transfusion

Splenectomy is indicated in patient with reflactory to prednisolone.

3.0 COAGULATION DISORDERS

     Venous thromboembolism is a common disorder with annual incidence of 117 per 100000
         persons;

     VTE comprise deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE);
     Most clinically important pulmonary embolism arise from proximal deep vein thrombosis

         ie popliteal, femoral or iliac veins in at least 90%;
     Other less common source are deep pelvis veins, renal veins, inferior vena cava, axillary

         veins and Rt side of the heart.

3.1 Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Propagative

Clinical features of Deep Vein Thrombosis includes
     Leg pain, tenderness and swelling.
     A palpable cord representing thrombosed vessels.
     Discoloration, venous distention and prominence of superficial veins and cyanosis.
     The clinical diagnosis of DVT is highly nonspecific.

251 | P a g e
 In most patients the symptoms and signs are nonspecific.

3.2 Pulmonary embolism (PE)

Clinical features of PE includes
     Transient dyspnea and tachypnea in the absence of other clinical features
     Pleuritic chest pain,cough, haemoptysis,pleural effusion, and pulmonary infiltrate
     Severe dyspnea nad tachypnea and right side heart failure
     Cardiovascular collapse with hypotension, syncope, and coma
     Several less common and nonspecific presentation including unexplained tachycardia or
         arrhythmia, resistant cardiac failure, wheezing, cough, fever, apprehension and
         confusion.

Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism
Long term anticoagulation is required to prevent a frequency of symptomatic extension of
thrombosis and/or recurrent venous thromboembolic events. Warfarin is started with initial
heparin or clexane therapy and then overlapped for 4-5days.

                   D: Warfarin 5mg PO for 4-5 days
                                       OR

        S:Low Molecular weight Heparin 1mg/kg subcuteneos for 4-5days
                   D: Unfractionated Heparin by IV 75units/kg followed by continuos

               Infusion of 18units/kg/hrs.
                   For small adult or child lower loading dose then 15-25Units /kg/hr
                   by IV infusion or 250units/kg every 12hrs by subcutaneous injection.

Pregnant woman

                S: Clexane 1mg/kg and should be monitored by anti-Xa levels.

NOTE
Warfarin therapy should be monitore by INR after 5-7 days of treatment. Heparin should be
monitored by aPTT before treatment is initiated and monitor aPTT hourly until aPTT is twice of
the initial.

                            TRAUMA & INJURIES

1.0 GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF TRAUMA

Major trauma is associated with fractures, multiple lacerations and other major injuries. Major
trauma may occur as a result of motor vehicle accidents or fights. The aim in handling major
trauma is to look for life threatening complications which if missed may endanger the patient's
life.

Diagnosis
     There is usually a history of trauma or accident
     If the patient is conscious he/she may complain of pain at specific places on his/her
         body
     Some patients may present with confusion, some semi-conscious and others may be in
         coma and/or shock

General Treatment

2.0 TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES

It is any episode of trauma to the head. We will exclude maxillo-facial injuries and eye injuries
from this discussion (Ref this to eye section). Mortality is increased if hypotension or
airway/breathing problem is not adequately solved.

254 | P a g e
Diagnosis
     Head injury may be associated with ophthalmic, ENT and dental injuries which are
         discussed separately.
     It is classified into two:
         - Involving scalp only;
         - Traumatic brain injury

        Table 2: Illustration of Traumatic Brain Injuries

Mild Traumatic Brain injury -Glasgow coma scale 13-14

                   -Involves a "brief" period of loss of consciousness

                   -Good progress with minimal or no long term sequel

Moderate Traumatic Brain - Glasgow coma scale 9-12

Injury             -Confused patient with focal neurological deficits but able to follow simple

                   commands

                   -Some mild long-term sequel

                   -Good prognosis

Severe  Traumatic  Brain - Glasgow coma scale <8 (This is the definition of coma)
injury                       -Unable to follow commands initially
                             - Significant long-term disability

3.0. INJURIES

3.1 Soft tissue injuries

Diagnosis

     Pain only, traumatic swelling, bruises with intact skin, cuts, abrasions, puncture wounds
         or open wounds of varying size and severity

     Injury to internal organs must be recognized and referred, including subtle signs of
         organ damage, e.g.:
                             o blood in the urine ­ kidney or bladder damage
                             o shock ­ internal bleeding
                             o blood or serous drainage from the ear or nose ­ skull base fracture

 An injury causing a sprain or strain may be initially overlooked. Exclude fractures by
    performing appropriate X-rays

Note  Referral must not be delayed by waiting for a diagnosis if treatment is logistically
      impossible
      Closed injuries and fractures of long bones may be serious and damage blood vessels
      Contamination with dirt and soil complicates the outcome of treatment
    

                   I. Emergency management
 Immobilize injured limb by POP cast or splint
 Monitor vital signs
 Monitor the arterial pulse and capillary refill below an injury on the limb with swelling.

                   II. Wound care
 Clean the wound
 Suture or splint when needed
 Avoid primary suture if the wound is infected:

              - Dirty or contaminated
              - Crushed
              - In need of debridement
              - Projectile inflicted
              - Caused by bites

                   III. Treatment
                        A: Paracetamol 15 mg/kg (O) 4­6 hourly when required. Maximum of 4

               doses per 24 hours

3.2 Sprains and Strains

Diagnosis
     Pain, especially on movement
     Tenderness on touch
     Limited movement
     History of trauma

These may be caused by:

     Sport injuries
     Slips and twists
     Overuse of muscles
     Abnormal posture

Note: In children always bear non-accidental injuries (assault) in mind.

1 Emergency treatment
     Immobilize with firm bandage and/or temporary splinting e.g. triangular sling, back slab
         etc
     Children over 12 years and adults:
                             A: Ibuprofen 200­400mg (O) 8 hourly with or after a meal

                             A: Paracetamol, oral, 15 mg/kg 4­6 hourly when required. Maximum of 4
                             doses per 24 hours. In children less than 6 months calculate dose by
                             weight
     Perform X-ray to rule out dislocations or sublaxations

2 Referral
     If Severe progressive pain. Do X-ray to exclude bone fractures or joint dislocation.
     Progressive swelling
     Extensive bruising
     Deformity
     Joint tenderness on bone
     No response to treatment
     Severe limitation of movement

258 | P a g e
3.3 Extremity Fractures

Fractures of long bones of upper and lower limbs are quite common. If not properly treated
they often lead to long-term deformities. Osteomyelitis is always the complication of open
fractures. Hemorrhagic shock may ensue in situations involving multiple fractures or pelvic ring
fractures.

Diagnosis
     Pain
     Swelling
     Loss of limb function
     Deformity and abnormal movement
     X-ray is mandatory to confirm the deformity

Management
Community / dispensary level

     Immobilize injured limb by POP cast or splint.
     Monitor vital signs.
     Monitor the arterial pulse and capillary refill below an injury on the limb with swelling
     Refer the patient

Health Centre
     Immobilize injured limb by POP cast or splint
     Monitor vital signs
     Monitor the arterial pulse and capillary refill below an injury on the limb with swelling
     Give tetanus toxoid to non immune cases
     Refer the patient if open fracture or if specialist service not available

Hospital level
     Immobilize injured limb by POP cast or splint
     Monitor vital signs
     Monitor the arterial pulse and capillary refill below an injury on the limb with swelling
     Treat open fractures by proper surgical debridement and ORIF as per specialist
         guideline.

3.4 Spine fractures

Motor traffic injuries and falls constitute the burden of most spine injuries. Paralysis may be
associated, often been brought by improper transfer of the patient to the hospital. C-spine
injury is always accompanied by traumatic brain injury.

Diagnosis
     History of tra\uma
     Pain
     Neurological deficit
     X-ray, CT scan and MRI are mandatory.

259 | P a g e
Treatment
     Immobilize the neck by collar or pillows/sand bags
     Patient should lie flat in bed, preferably the flat bed or air matress
     Treat shock as per the guideline
     Catheterize if urine retention
     Immediate transfer to the hospital that handles spine surgeries

4.0 BITES

4.1 Animal Bites

Animals that bite man include both wild and domesticated ones. Thus lion, tiger, leopard,
hyena, bear, elephant, hippopotamus, buffalo, wolf and wild pig are examples of the wild
animals that have bitten man. Others are fish, crocodiles and dogs. Clinical features of these
bites arise from the pathology inflicted by teeth, tusks, claws and horns. They produce
lacerations, penetrating and crushing injuries. Severe facial and eye innuries are common and
pneumothorax, hemothorax, bowel perofration and compound fractures have occurred.

Treatment
     Emergency surgery is often needed
     Replace any blood lost
     Treat complications of injury e.g. resultant rabies, tetanus, pneumothorax
     Treat infection with relevant antibiotics.

Give Tetanus Toxoid 0.5ml start. Repeat after 4 weeks and then 6-12 months later

4.2 Insects Bites

Important insects' bites are those from scorpions.

Symptoms:Most bites and stings result in pain, swelling, redness, and itching to the affected
area

Treatment and Management
Treatment depends on the type of reaction

     Cleanse the area with soap and water to remove contaminated particlesleft behind by
         some insects

     Refrain from scratching because this may cause the skin to break down and an infection
         to form

     Treat itching at the site of the bite with antihistamine
     Give appropriate analgesics
     Where there is an anaphylactic reaction treat according to guideline.

4.3 Snake Bites

         Refer to the poisoning chapter.

260 | P a g e
5.0 BURNS

It is thermal trauma to the skin, mucosae and deeper tissues. Classification depends on depth
and extent. If area burnt is larger than 10% of body surface then this is extensive because of
fluid loss, catabolism, anaemia and risk of secondary infection.

The `rule of 9' to calculate % of body surface burned, can be used.

Table 5: Rule of Nine for calculatin % of Body surface burned

Body Areas     Adult (%) Child %

Entire head    9                           18

Upper limb     9                           18

Anterior or posterior surface of trunk 18  18

Lower limb     18                          14

Perineum       1                           1

Treatment
Ensure that there is an adequate airway, adequate breathing and adequate circulation

     Immerse burnt area in cold water for 10 minutes
     Clean with Normal saline or Chlorhexidine ­ cetrimide solution
     Apply Gentian Violet solution
     Do not cover

6.0 FOREIGN BODIES

Foreign bodies may be introduced into any of the body orifices nose, ears, vagina and urethra.
Foreign bodies introduced through the mouth (or nose) may be arrested in the larynx, bronchial
tree, oesophagus or stomach.

Diagnosis
It depends on the affected site. The symptoms may be due to obstruction or inflammation
around the foreign body.

261 | P a g e
Treatment Guidelines
Foreign bodies into the ears, nose, urethra, vagina, larynx and bronchial tree invariably should
be removed. Foreign bodies in the stomach rarely produce symptoms and active treatment is
usaullynot required.

                 MALIGNANT DISEASE CONDITIONS

Cancer is a word covering a wide range of malignant diseases which contribute significantly to
the overall morbidity and mortality of people world-wide. The true magnitude of the cancer
situation in Tanzania is unknown, however more than 3000 new cases are recorded in ORCI-
based registry; and that is estimated to be only 10% of cancer incidence in the country.

1.0 GYNAECOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES

1.1 Carcinoma of the cervix (Cacx)

Clinical features:
     Asymptomatic if early
     Later predominant symptoms are: Postcoital, intermenstrual or postmenopausal vaginal
         bleeding.
     Pain and incontinence are rather late symptoms.

Investigations:
     Laboratory tests: FBC, LFTs, creatinine, urea,
     Radiological investigations: CXR, abdominal/pelvic ultrasonography, IVU.
     Biopsy of cervix or abnormal Papanicolaou smear or VIA/Vili during screening confirm
         the diagnosis.
     Bimanual examination under anaesthesia (EUA), recto-vagina examination is mandatory
         for proper disease staging.

Histopathology: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-90%,
                 Adenocarcinoma -10%,
                 Rarely ­ others ­ clear cell, small cell, sarcoma, etc

Staging: FIGO: IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IVA and IVB
     Early cancer stages IB, IIA, and selected IIB)
     Late cancer stages IIB bulky, IIIA, and IIIB)

      Laboratory :FBC, LFTs, urea, creatinine
      Radiological: IVU, CXR, Abdominal/pelvic USS.
      Cytology: Endometrial curettings confirm the diagnosis.
      Both inspection and bimanual examination under anaesthesia (EUA) recto-vagina are
          mandatory.

Histology: Usually Adenocarcinoma
                Others: Clear cell, small cell carcinomas, sarcomas.

Histological grade bears the prognosis: GI better than GIII.

Treatment:
Surgery: TAHBSO with generous vaginal cuff removal suffices for early stages.

264 | P a g e
Radiotherapy: Post- operative radiotherapy is indicated for high risk patients (node positive,
higher grades II, III and positive margins). ICT is indicated in case of parametrial and vaginal
involvement. EBRT/ICT alone is indicated for patients who have contraindication for surgery or
too advanced disease. Chemotherapy with RT is indicated for uterine sarcoma sequentially. RT

    sites and Lymphadenopathy of the groin is involved

Investigations:

      Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, Urea, creatinine

      Radiological: IVU, CXR, Ultrasonography of abdomen and pelvis.

      Both inspection and bimanual examination under anaesthesia (EUA) recto-vagina are

of treatment. Decision of treatment for the vulvo-vaginal carcinoma is best done in hospital
under specialist care. Regional/zonal or tertiary depending on treatment expertise

Treatment: Predominantly surgical. Aim: Cure.

Surgery: Wide excision of the primary site and lymphadenectomy for early stages.
Radiotherapy: Post- operative radiotherapy is indicated for high risk recurrence (positive

265 | P a g e
margins and nodal involvement). ICT is indicated in case of vaginal involvement.

advanced stages not amenable for surgery.

Chemotherapy regimen: See chemotherapy for cervical cancer.

1.4 Malignant Trophoblastic disease

Clinical features: Rare solid tumour. Usually follows pregnancy which has resulted in a
hydatidiform mole. This may accompany normal, ectopic or even termination of pregnancy.
Patient presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding during or after pregnancy associated with a
"large-for-date" uterus. Other findings include: marked symptoms of pregnancy or pre-
eclampsia.

Investigations:
      Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, urea, creatinine, Levels of ßHCG, 24-hour
                        urinary HCG
      Radiological: CXR, CT scans according to symptoms to confirm
                          metastases, abdominal/pelvic USS

      Cytology: Curretings from D&C.

Histology: Choriocarcinoma, Hydatidform mole, chorioadenoma destruens

Staging: Low risk, moderate risk and High risk groups are defined by prognostic variables such
as: Interval between antecedent pregnancy and the start of chemotherapy, height of initial HCG
levels, number, size and site of metastases (the brain is a particularly adverse site), age of the
patient (older patients do worse), parity, previous administration of chemotherapy if any.

Referral: All patients must be referred to a gynecologist for evaluation and decision on mode
of treatment. Decision of treatment for malignant trophoblastic tumours is best done in hospital
under specialist care. Regional/zonal or tertiary depending on treatment expertise.

Treatment

Surgery: Trial of D & C and if symptoms continue ­ Hysterectomy.

Chemotherapy: Choriocarcinoma is extremely chemosensitive. It can be cured even when
metastatic.

Low risk patient (Patient with above minimal prognostic indicators): - Methotrexate (MTX)
50mg i/m Day 1, 3, 5, 7 then Folinic acid 6mg i/m Day 2, 4, 6, and 8. Methotrexate single agent
and higher doses of MTX with folinic acid rescue are indicated for early disease (low risk).

Repeat cycles every 6 days, continue 8 weeks after HCG has become undetectable.

Moderate and high risk patients (Those with worse above prognostic indicators):
Combination chemotherapy:

MTX + Actinomycin- D + Cyclophosphamide + Etoposide:

266 | P a g e
D1: MTX 50mg i/v in 200mls N/S over 3 hrs; Etoposide 100mg i/v in 200mls N/S over 30
minutes; Actinomycin-D 0.5mg i/v

D2: : MTX 50mg i/v in 200mls N/S over 3 hrs; Actinomycin-D 0.5mg i/v; Folinic acid 6mg i/m or
i/v.

D3: Folinic acid 6mg i/m or i/v

Repeat cycle after 6 days. Cycles are continued for 8 wks after HCG in serum has become
undetectable *wkly assay).

Note: Response is assessed by serial ßHCG measurement, and treatment repeated until the
marker has been undetectable in the serum for 6 ­ 8 weeks.

1.5 Cancer of the Ovary

Epithelial tumours: Comprise 90% of ovarian malignancies.
Clinical features: Minimal or no symptoms early on. However increasing abdominal
distension, palpable mass in the abdomen, pain and presence of ascites are all late signs.

Investigations:

      Laboratory: FBC, U&Es, LFTs;
      Radiological: CXR, CT scans, Pelvic and abdominal ultrasound, etc according to

          complaints.
      Histology of oophorectomy specimen or biopsy obtained at laparatomy.

Histologies of epithelial tumours: Serous (cyst) adenoma, mucinous (cyst) adenoma,
endometrioid adenocarcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, granulosa cell tumour, theca cell
tumour, sertoli-Leydig cell tumour, mixed tumours.
Staging: Is surgical (laparatomy): FIGO: IA, IB, IC, IIA, IIB, IIC, III, and IV.

Referral: All patients must be referred to a gynecologist for evaluation and decision on mode
of treatment. Decision of treatment for malignant trophoblastic tumours is best done in hospital
under specialist care. Regional/zonal or tertiary depending on treatment expertise.

Treatment:
Surgery: TAHBSO with omentectomy. If total tumour removal is not possible, then maximum
debulking (cyto-reductive) surgery should be done. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is only
justified for stage IA tumour with favourable histology.

Chemotherapy
Adjuvant chemotherapy: Is indicated for all unfavourable histologies as well as advanced
stages.

Chemotherapy regimen
                   A:D0: Prehydration: 0.9 NS 3000mls/24 hrs
                                       Plus
                   S: D1: Paclitaxel 175mg/sq m

267 | P a g e
                               Plus
                   S: Cisplatin 100mg/sq m
Cycle: Every 21 days x 6 cycles with FBC, Electrolytes, Urea, Creatinine and 24-hr creatinine
clearance check prior to each treatment.
Radiotherapy
It is recommended for residual or recurrent disease. Whole abdominal radiation 30GY/20F/4wks
with pelvic boost to 50Gy can produce long remissions. However contraindication to RT:
Massive ascites and marked weight loss.

2.0 CANCERS OF THE SKIN

2.1 Non-melanotic skin cancers

Clinical features: Chronic sun exposure, old burns, non-healing ulcer and nodal involvement.
The most common warning sign of skin cancer is a change in the appearance on exposed areas
of the skin, such as a new growth or a sore that will not heal. Occasionally, such changes may
appear on an old burn area.

Investigation:
      None if lesion is small.
      Local x-ray if bone involvement is suspected. CXR if undifferentiated tumour,
      Biopsy ­ preferrably excisional biopsy where possible.

Histologies: Basal cell (BCC) and Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC).

Staging: TNM staging classification

Referral only where indicated in case expertise is required.

Surgery: The aim of sugery is total local excision where possible; wide local excision and graft;
amputation sometimes is required. Locally destructive methods such as curetting, desiccating or
cryotherapy may be emplyted.

Radiotherapy: Indication: Positive margin, high grade disease or inoperable tumour.

Chemotherapy:

                   S: Topical 5- fluorouracil for very superficial lesions or carcinoma in situ.

      Systemic chemotherapy: for advanced stages as radiosensitizer in conjunction with
          cisplatin:

                   S: Cisplatin 50mg infusion wkly x 6 concomitantly with RT.

Prehydration is mandatory, FBC & blood chemistry is mandatory before every cycle (see cacx).

Detection/Prevention: Frequent self-check or screening exercise and prompt treatment of
early keratotic changes. For light skinned people-avoid U/V light.

268 | P a g e
2.2 Malignant melanoma

Clinical features: History of a pre-existing naevus which has changed recently ­ itching,
colour change, increase in size, satellite lesions, elevated surface, ulceration and/or oozing.

Investigation:
     None or minimal if lesion is small
     Radiological: Chest x-ray in case of clinically suspected lung involvement or abdominal
         ultrasound in case of suspected liver metastases.
     Excisional biopsy of suspicious lesion and finding of malignant melanocytes within the
         lesion.

Staging: Clark's or Breslow classifications are used. Tumour size closely correlates
              with prognosis.

Detection/Prevention: Frequent self-check or screening exercise and prompt
                                   treatment of naevus.

Referral where indicated. Aim: Cure for early localized lesion.

Treatment

Surgery:

      The aim of sugery is total local excision where possible.

      Wide local excision and graft

      Amputation sometimes for advanced useless limb.

Chemotherapy: Not effective. Temozolamide and DTIC can be tried.

Radiation: Not first choice; but can be performed if:
     Lesion is inoperable. May use large fractions: 30Gy/6F/1 wk
     Excision margins are involved or very close
     Palliative intent (brain mets, fungation or profuse bleeding, bone pain, etc)

2.3 Kaposis Sarcoma (KS)

Definition: Kaposi's sarcoma is a malignant tumour of angio-formative cells usually starting
from the skin but occasionally involving many other organs of the body. There are three
epidemiological variants-sporadic, endemic and epidemic forms which may or may not be
associated with infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These two types are
commonly referred to as: Non AIDS related (endemic) KS and AIDS related (epidemic) KS.

Clinical features:
      KS presents as a firm, dark brown nodules or plaque in the skin. Usually more on the
          limbs.
      In young children and those with immunodeficiency it presents as wide spread
          lymphadenopathy with or without skin lesions.

269 | P a g e
      Presence of B symptoms (fever, sweating and weight loss) is commonly associated with
          epidemic type.

      Clinical course can be indolent or aggressive.

Investigations:
     Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, Urea & creatinine, Elisa test with confirmation
     Radiological: CXR in case of symptoms
     Skin biopsy followed by histological confirmation

Histological appearance for both endemic and epidemic types is the same.

Referral
Patients with AIDS related KS are referred to CTC clinic. Uses of ARVs are mandatory for
patients with epidemic disease.

Treatment:

Chemotherapy:
     Adults:
                   S: Adriamycin 40mg/sq m i/v D1
                                       Plus
                   S: Vincristine 1.4mg/sq m i/v D1

                   S: Bleomycin 7.5mg/sq m i/v D1.

Repeat ABV every 3 wks x 6. FBC check is mandatory before each treatment.
Note: Pegylated liposomal Doxorubicine (PLD) is superior.

     Children under 12 years:

                   S: Actinomycin-D 15microgram/kg i/v D1 ­ D5

                                       Plus

                   S: Vincristine 1.5mg/m sq i/v D1, D8.

Repeat every 3 wks until remission then give further 2 courses.

Radiotherapy:

Indication: Palliation of pain, bleeding, oozing and fungation.

Note:
     Sequential hemibody irradiation is sometimes necessary for aggressive disease. 6Gy /SF
         followed by 6wks interval before other half is treated.
     Check FBC for guidance before treatment. 24-hr observation is mandatory when
         treating upper hemibody (UHB), Vital signs should be monitored.

270 | P a g e
3.0 HEAD AND NECK CANCERS

Definition: Carcinomas of the head and neck constitute an important group of tumours. They
may interfere with vital functions such as: Respiratory, swallowing, sight, speech and
mastication. Important aetiological factors include excessive intake of tobacco either by
smoking or chewing and alcohol intake (particularly spirits).

Clinical features: Presence of premalignant lesions in buccal mucosa and tongue. Other
features include: Non-healing ulcers, lymphadenopathy, hoarseness, pain and difficult in
swallowing.

Investigations:

     Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, Urea & creatinine

     Radiological:, CXR or CT scan of the region as indicated.

     Direct/indirect laryngoscopy/panendoscopy/bronchoscopy plus biopsy

Histologies: Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histology, though the frequency of
other histological types and the degree of differentiation varies markedly with site. Other
histologies include: Adenocarcinoma, mucoepidermoid, acinic, adenoid cystic carcinomas, basal
cell carcinoma, KS, lymphomas, plasmacytoma, sarcoma, melanoma, verrucous carcinoma ,
rhabdomyosarcoma.

Staging: TNM

Referral: All patients must be referred to tertiary hospitals for evaluation and decision on mode
of treatment. Decisions of treatment for head and neck tumours are best discussed at Tumour
board.

Treatments

 The treatment plan for an individual patient depends on a number of factors: in the exact
    location of the tumor, the disease stage, the person's age and general health.

 Radiotherapy:

- Is standard treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and other inoperable

  tumours of head and neck.

       40 ­ 60Gy/20-30F/4-6 wks.

     - Palliative RT: To relieve pain, reduce swelling, ulceration and bleeding.

        30Gy/10F/2wks.

 Chemoradiation is a superior treatment of choice for all stages though mainly an early
     stage because this mode of treatment preserves anatomical functions including voice.

     Regimen: Cisplatinum 100mg infusion D1+ 625mg 5FU D1 ­ D4

         D0, D1 as above only substitute Mitomycin C 10mg/sq m for 5-FU.
 CHOP x 6 is standard treatment for lymphomas.

Surgery:

 Partial or total laryngectomy is for advanced stages only where voice is compromised.
 Verrucous carcinoma is best treated surgically
 Leukoplakia should be excised totally

3.1 Thyroid carcinoma

Definition: This group of diseases is exceptional in many ways. Some thyroid cancers are very
indolent with long natural history. Tumour present as "goiter" and can remain silent for decades
without any discomfort.
Clinical features: Presence of a thyroid mass or scar, laryngeal nerve palsy, hoarseness,
dyspnoea, dysphagia.

Investigations:
     Laboratory:Thyroid function tests (T3, T4, TSH), FBC, LFTs, Urea & creatinine , serum
         calcitonin, serum thyroglobulin levels.

     Radiological:Thyroid scan, CXR, isotope bone scan, CT scan of the neck

     FNAC of a thyroid lesion

Histology: Four histological types: Papillary, Follicular, Medullary and Anaplastic

Staging: TNM

Referral: All patients must be referred to a specialized hospital for evaluation and decision on
mode of treatment. Decisions of treatment for thyroid tumours are best discussed at Tumour
board.

Treatment

     Radioactive iodine ablation

     Further thyroxine replacement therapy (for life).

272 | P a g e
Surgery: Total/near total thyroidectomy as indicated.
Radiotherapy: Is indicated in all cases of anaplastic carcinoma.
60Gy/30F/6wks
Chemotherapy: is still experimental.
Radioactive: Iodine ablation is indicated in all patients after surgery.
100mCi (3,500 MBq) is given 3-4 wks after surgery. NOTE: Stop T3 or T4 three wks before
ablative treatment.

4.0 GASTROINTESTINAL MALIGNANCIES

4.1 Esophageal cancer

It can develop as a result of long standing achalasia or chronic irritation. Smoking and alcohol
are both contributory.

Symptoms:
Difficult in swallowing (dysphagia) is the commonest symptom which is associated with weight
loss and poor performance status.

Investigations:

Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, urea , creatinine

Radiological: Barium swallow and meal, CT scan, Esophagoscopy, Abdominal USS,

Biopsy: Rigid oesophagoscopy or Oesophagoduodenoscopy (OGD) with a biopsy.

Histology: Majority are SCC, ADC (lower third of oesophagus)

Staging: TNM

Treatment: Palliation in most cases. Cure rate with any modality is 5-10%.

Chemoradiation: Is the treatment of choice and few patients can be cured.
     Cisplatinum & 4 day 5FU

                   A: D0: 0.9 %NS 3000 mls i/v over 24 hrs prehydration
                                       Plus

                   S: D1: Cisplatinum 80mg/sq m in 1 litre over 6 hrs
                                       Plus

                   S: D1- D4 5FU 625mg i/v in 1 litre over 2 hrs
     Synchronous Cisplatin with radiotherapy
Surgery: Only for very selective patients with curative intent. Often possible for lower third.

273 | P a g e
Paliative surgery: Had once been indicated for patients unable to swallow, feeding
gastrostomy has been recommended but does not improve quality of life or survival benefit.
Dilatation with or without intubation should always be considered to ensure continued ability to
swallow.

Radiotherapy alone: Any inoperable patient should be considered for RT on palliative basis.
30Gy/10F/2wks; 40Gy/20F/4wks
Intraluminal RT using HDR insertions in some centres.

4.2 Stomach Cancer

Clinical features: Epigastric pain worsened by food intake, early satiety, anorexia, weight
loss, weakness, and obstructive symptoms may be present with distal tumours. Bleeding occult
or manifest may be a feature.Look for pallor, weight loss, supraclavicular foss nodes, abdominal
and rectal examination, epigastric mass, hepatomegally, periumbilical nodes.

        Investigations:
              Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, stool for occult blood
              Radiological: Gastroscopy, CXR, Ba meal (double contrast), abdominal USS.
              Biopsy at surgery.

        Histology: Adenocarcinoma ­ 95%, NHL ­ 4%
         Others: Leiomyosarcoma,KS ­ 1%

         Staging: Surgical: I, II, III and IV.

         Treatment: Palliation in most cases.

         Surgery: Total or partial gastrectomy, bypass with or without tumour
         removal eg gastrojejunostomy.

         Chemotherapy: Combination therapy is the best approach: 5- FU,
                                 cisplatin, capecitabin, leucovorin, levamisole, CHOP
                                   in case of NHL.

         RT: Has a minimal role in chronic bleeding and relief of pain.

         Screening and early detection: Has a role in endemic regionslike in Japan.

4.3 Hepatocellular carcinoma

Clinical features: This is a malignant neoplasma of the liver which may occur either with or

7.0 GENITO-URINARY MALIGNANCY

7.1 Bladder cancer
Clinical features: Bladder cancer characteristically presents with haematuria. This may be
visible to the naked eye gross hematuria or detectable only by microscope. Other possible
symptoms include: Dysuria or increased frequency and bilharzia exposure, weight loss and
anaemia.

Investigations:

279 | P a g e
     Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, urea, creatinine, urinalysis, culture and sensitivity, urinefor
                 cytology

     Radiological: Bimanual examination under anaesthesia at time of cystoscopy, CXR,
                    IVU, abdominal and pelvic USS or CT scan of abdomen and pelvis..

     Biopsy is mandatory during cystoscopy.

Histology: SCC or Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).

Staging: TNM
Referral: All patients must be referred to tertiary hospital for evaluation and decision on mode
of treatment. Decisions of treatment for urinary bladder tumour are best discussed at Tumour
board.

Treatment:

     Surgery: Total cystectomy is mutilating and causes poor quality of life. This has been
         used for early bladder cancers.

     Chemoradiation yields better results and preserves bladder function.

     Palliative RT aims at reducing pain and massive bleeding.

7.2 Carcinoma of the Prostate

Carcinoma of prostate is among the commonest of all cancers in men and is the third largest
cause of death from cancer in males. Prostate cancer is associated with circulating testosterone
and family history is significant in a very small percentage of patients.

Clinical features:
     Early stages of this cancer is asymptomatic, meaning that it can run an indolent course
     May present incidentally following examination for benign prostatic hypertrophy or
         elevated serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA).
     Prostatic symptoms are associated with advanced stages of the disease, which include:
         reduced potency, urinary frequency and nocturia, poor stream, hesitancy and terminal
         dribbling. However, very often patient may present with bone pain ­ backache or
         pathological fracture.
     DRE typically reveals a hard, irregular prostate. TURP is carried out to both confirm the
         diagnosis and also as part of the treatment (to relieve obstruction).

Investigations:
     Laboratory: FBC, LFTs, urea, creatinine, serum PSA, acid phosphatase,
     Radiological: X-rays of the painful bone or spine, IVU, abdominal USS or transrectal
         ultrasound, bone scan.
     TURP for histological confirmation

280 | P a g e
Histology: All are adenocarcinomas. Histological grading is a good predictor of survival.
Gleason score provides prognostic information in addition to clinical stage.

Staging: TNM

Treatment
     Treatment is based on the stage of the disease, patient's age and functional
         performance of that individual
     Surveillance: Non-intervention may be appropriate particularly in an elderly man with
         limited life expectancy
     Surgery: Early stages can be treated with either radical prostatectomy with intention of
         Cure. However, surgery may cause postoperative impotence and impaired urinary
         control. Bilateral orchidectomy is a surgical procedure which aims at surgical castration
     Hormonal therapy: May be given as the sole treatment for patients deemed unfit for
         surgery. Alternatively hormonal therapy is used as adjunct to other treatments with the
         intention of reducing the chance of local recurrence or metastatic disease.
         Androgen ablation/medical castration: inj. Zoladex 3.6md s/c every 28 days + Tab
         Casodex 50 mg od PO daily until PSA normalizes.
     Radiotherapy: Early stages can also be treated with radical RT. Palliative radiotherapy
         is valuable to bone metastases, massive haematuria, spinal cord compression,
         pathological fracture, etc as indicated.
         64Gy/32F/6.5wks
     Chemotherapy: Some chemo drugs have shown effect on refractory prostatic disease:
                   S:Docetaxel 135mg/sq m i/v infusion D1 after premedication cover x 6 cycles.
     Cancer of prostate medical emergency: Spinal cord compression: Steroids-

                   S:Dexamethasone 8mg 8hrly x 72 hrs then orally x io days

                                       Plus
                   S: Radiotherapy to the affected area

                                       Plus
                   S: Intensive physiotherapy.

Detection/Prevention: Prostate cancer is among the cancers in human beings which could
be prevented by screening procedures. Annual check up for a man 50 years and above is
mandatory. Digital rectal examination (DRE) coupled with PSA check is enough to control
incidence of this killer disease in men.

                                     MALARIA

1.0 Overview of Malaria

Malaria is a parasitic infectious disease presenting with fever, chills and profuse sweating.
However, patient with malaria infection may be completely asymptomatic.

Diagnosis
The clinical features of malaria vary from mild to severe. The disease presentation will vary
according to patient's state of immunity, the intensity of the infection and the presence of
accompany conditions such as malnutrition, anaemia and other diseases.

Signs and Symptoms inludes:-

malaise, fever, fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, anorexia, chill, rigors, sweats, headache, cough,
vomiting and diarrhea etc.

The above signs and symptoms are not specific for malaria and can be found in other disease
conditions. Therefore it is necessary to investigate for other causes of febrile illness.

Laboratory investigation is mandatory and urgent for all patients admitted with severe malaria.
Parasite-based diagnosis by microscopy is important while rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) may
be an alternative. Laboratory tests should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings.

Management
The management and referral for patient with malaria will be determined by the clinical
presentation and the diagnosis of either uncomplicated or severe disease, as well as results of
RDT and/or microscopy (see flow chart -Figure 1).

In children under five years of age, IMCI practical algorithms for management of sick child with
fever should be used to ensure full assessment and appropriate case management of children,
in particular at the primary level health.

In the case of negative blood slide/RDT without signs or symptoms of severe disease, look for
other causes, manage and follow up accordingly, and ask the patient to come back if condition
does not improve. The exception is in children under 5 years living in high malaria transmission
areas, if unable to return for follow up or in case the condition worsens, treat as for
uncomplicated malaria.

2.0 Treatment of Uncomplicated Malaria

Definition: Uncomplicated malaria is defined as symptomatic malaria without signs of severity
or evidence (clinical or laboratory) of vital organ dysfunction.

Give antimalarial medicines only to those who test positive for parasites.
Treatment on the basis of clinical suspicion alone should only be considered if parasitological
diagnosis is not accessible.

The objectives of treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:
· To provide rapid and long lasting clinical and parasitological cure
· To reduce morbidity including malaria related anaemia
· To halt the progression of simple disease into severe and potentially fatal disease

Since the progression towards severe and fatal disease is rapid, especially in children under five
years of age, it is recommended that diagnosis and initiation of treatment of uncomplicated
malaria should be within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms.

First line:
     Artemether Lumefantrine (ALu).
     Standard tablet: fixed formulation Artemether 20mg, Lumefantrine 120mg
     Dispersible tablet: fixed formulation for children, Artemether 20 mg, Lumefantrine

in the second and third day of treatment until completion of 6 doses.
Note: Artemether-Lumefantrine is not recommended for:

         · Infants below 5kg body weight:
         Malaria is quite uncommon in infants below 2 months of age (approximately below 5
         kg). Rarely, congenital and neonatal malaria does occur. ALu is currently not
         recommended for infant below 5kg body weight because the dosing and safety profile of
         the partner component lumefantrine is not well studied. Therefore, an artemisinin alone
         is the drug of choice as 1st line treatment in the category of neonates and infants below
         5Kg, treating as for severe malaria. Injectable quinine remains a suitable alternative
         where artesunate is not available. See section on Treatment of Severe Malaria for
         dosage of parenteral artesunate.
         · First trimester of pregnancy: See section on Malaria in pregnancy

During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy Artemether-Lumefantrine should be used
as drug of choice for treatment of uncomplicated malaria

As far as possible malaria cases should be followed up on the third day if symptoms persist or
immediately if the condition worsens. Failure to respond to the recommended drug regimen
indicates the need for further investigations and appropriate management, with referral if
needed.

Where a patient returns between 4 to 14 days after treatment with ALU complaining of
continued symptoms of malaria, non-response should be considered and the following
recommendations followed after a full history and examination:

         · Where laboratory facilities are not available and malaria is still suspected, second line
         treatment should be started immediately with strict follow up
         · Where laboratory facilities are available, a blood smear (and not RDT) should be
         examined. If parasites are found second line treatment should be started and treatment
         failure recorded. If parasites are not found other causes for the symptoms should be
         sought and treated accordingly

Second line for uncomplicated malaria:
Dihydroartemisinin plus Piperaquine (DPQ)

     Fixed-dose combination with tablets containing

         C: Dihydroartemisinin (D) and Piperaquine (PQ).

3.0 Treatment of Severe Malaria

Severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a medical emergency. Delay in diagnosis and provision
of appropriate treatment may lead to serious complications and even death. In Tanzania the
commonest presentations of severe malaria are severe anaemia and coma (cerebral Malaria).
Complications include hyperpyrexia, convulsions, shock, hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis,
acute renal failure or pulmonary oedema

Early diagnosis of severe malaria based upon a complete history, physical examination
and where possible, blood smear or rapid diagnostic test (RDT) examination for malaria
parasites. Taking and reporting of blood smear must not be allowed to delay treatment unduly.

Definition: In a patient with P.falciparum asexual parasitaemia and no other obvious cause of
symptoms the presence of one or more of features listed below classify the patient as suffering
from severe malaria.

293 | P a g e
NOTE: If effective management of severe malaria and supportive care for complications is not
possible, patients should be given pre-referral treatment and referred immediately to an
appropriate facility for continued treatment.

Pre-referral treatment options:
                   B: Artesunate IM/rectal
                             OR
                   B: Quinine IM

Rectal artesunate is the recommended pre-referral treatment at the community level. At a
health facility the pre-referral dose of parenteral therapy should be initiated without delay.

Pre-referral rectal artesunate:
     Available as suppository containing 50mg or 100mg or 400mg

    Dosage regimen:
Single dose of 10 mg/kg body weight artesunate should be administered rectally. In the event
that an artesunate suppository is expelled from the rectum within 30 min of insertion, a second
suppository should be inserted and, especially in young children, the buttocks should be held
together for 10 min to ensure retention of the rectal dose of artesunate.

Pre-referral artesunate IM:
     Artesunate is provided as a powder vial of artesunic acid with a 1ml ampoule of diluent
         sodium bicarbonate solution 5%. Reconstitute for IM injection:
              o The vial of artesunatepowder is mixed with 1ml of diluent sodium bicarbonate
                   solution to form sodium artesunate. Shake for 2-3 minutes until completely
                   dissolved and solution is clear. The solution is 60mg/ml artesunate
              o Dilute with 2ml of 5% dextrose or dextrose/saline. The concentration is now
                   20mg/ml artesunate.
         One vial makes 3ml solution (20mg/ml) for IM injection. Use immediately; discard any
         solution not used within 1 hour.

Dosage regimen:
Single dose of 2.4 mg/kg body weight administered by intramuscular injection to the anterior
thigh after reconstituted and diluted as directed.

Pre-referral Quinine IM:
     Dilution of Quinine Dihydrochloride injection (300 mg/ml) for intra-muscular use:

One part of Quinine solution should be diluted with four parts water for injection to a
concentration of 60 mg/ml. This dilution will minimize the risk of sterile abscess formation.

    Dosage regimen:
Give single dose of 10mg of quinine salt per kg bodyweight (not exceeding a maximum dose of
600mg). The calculated dose should be divided into two halves and then administered by deep
intra-muscular injection preferably into the mid anterolateral aspect of the thigh (one injection
on each side).

Treatment of Severe Malaria
Treatment in both children and adults where facilities for admission and effective management
of severe malaria are available:

First choice:
         Artesunate 2.4 mg/kg body weight IV or IM given on admission (time = 0), then at 12
         hours and 24 hours, then once a day.

Artesunate (i.v. infusion)
     Artesunate is provided as a powder vial of artesunic acid with a 1ml ampoule of diluent
         sodium bicarbonate solution 5%. Reconstitute for IV injection:
              o The vial of artesunatepowder is mixed with 1ml of diluent sodium bicarbonate
                   solution to form sodium artesunate. Shake for 2-3 minutes until completely
                   dissolved and solution is clear. The solution is 60mg/ml artesunate
              o Dilute with 5ml of 5% dextrose or dextrose/saline. The concentration is now
                   10mg/ml artesunate.
         One vial makes 6ml solution (10mg/ml) for IV injection. Use immediately; discard any
         solution not used within 1 hour.

Alternative if parenteral artesunate is not available:
         Quinine 20 mg salt/kg body weight (BW) on admission (IV infusion or divided IM
         injection), then 10 mg/kg BW every 8 hours; infusion rate should not exceed 5 mg
         salt/kg BW per hour.

Quinine (i.v. infusion)
Quinine dose: 10 mg/kg body weight of salt, to be diluted in 5-10 ml/kg body weight of 5%
Dextrose or dextrose-saline and infused over 4 hours and repeated every 8 hours. Infusions
should be discontinued as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication. Patients should be
properly instructed to complete the 7-day treatment with quinine tablets or, alternatively, a full
course of ALu may be administered to complete treatment

The drop rate for quinine IV infusion is calculated as follows:
         Drop rate per minute = amount of fluid to be infused (in ml) x 20 (drop factor) / time
         period to be infused (in minutes)

The table below is given for easier calculation.

Give parenteral antimalarials in the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24 h, once
started (irrespective of the patient's ability to tolerate oral medication earlier), and, thereafter,
complete treatment by giving a complete course (3 days) of:

                   A: Artemether plus lumefantrine (ALu),
                                       OR

                   C: Dihydroartemisinin plus piperaquine (DPQ),

General measures for severe malaria
· Treatment of hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia remains a major problem in the management of
severe malaria especially in young children and pregnant women. It should be deliberately
looked for and treated accordingly.

· Coma (cerebral malaria): maintain airway, nurse on side, and exclude other causes of coma
( e.g. hypoglycaemia, bacteria meningitis); avoid giving corticosteroids
· Hyperpyrexia: fanning, paracetamol (preferred over NSAIDs)
· Convulsions: maintain airways; treat with rectal or IV diazepam.
· Hypoglycaemia: urgent and repeated blood glucose screening;
· In children: give 5 mls/kg of 10% dextrose OR 2.5 mls/kg of 25% dextrose as bolus; if 50%
dextrose solution is available, it should be diluted to make 25% by adding an equal volume of
water for injection or normal saline
· In adults: give 125 mls of 10% dextrose OR 50 mls of 25% dextrose dextrose as bolus
· Where dextrose is not available, sugar water should be prepared by mixing 20 gm of sugar
(4-level tea spoons) with 200 ml of clean water. 50 ml of this solution is given ORALLY or by
naso-gastric tube if unconscious
· Severe anaemia: transfusion of packed cells if Hb equal or less than 4 g/dl and/or signs of
heart failure and/or signs of respiratory distress
· Acute pulmonary oedema: Prop patient up to 45 degree angle; review fluid balance and
run patient on "dry side"; give diuretic but avoiding inadequate perfusion of kidneys; set up
Central Venous pressure (CVP) line, give oxygen. Intubation/ventilation may be necessary

298 | P a g e
· Acute renal failure: exclude pre-renal causes, check fluid balance and urinary sodium. If
adequately hydrated (CVP>5cm) try diuretics. Haemodialysis /haemofiltration (or if available
peritoneal dialysis) should be started early in established renal failure.

4.0 Management of malaria in pregnancy

Malaria is an important cause of morbidity and mortality for the pregnant woman, the foetus
and the newborn. The effects of malaria in pregnancy are related to the malaria endemicity,
with abortion more common in areas of low endemicity and intrauterine growth retardation
more common in areas of high endemicity. Early diagnosis and effective case management of
malaria illness in pregnant women is crucial in preventing the progression of uncomplicated
malaria to severe disease and death.

4.1 Management of uncomplicated malaria in the first trimester

If a laboratory blood slide is negative, it does not rule out malaria. RDTs have an added value,
as they can be positive even if parasites are hidden in the placenta.

Note: During the second and third trimesters of pregnancy Artemether-Lumefantrine is the drug
of choice for treatment of uncomplicated malaria

First trimester:
During the first trimester of pregnancy, treat with quinine plus clindamycin for seven days or
quinine alone if clindamycin is not available or unaffordable.

Quinine is safe in pregnancy. In therapeutic doses it does not induce labour. Uterine
contractions and foetal distress with the use of quinine may be attributable to fever and effects
of malaria disease. Clindamycin is considered safe in the first trimester of pregnancy. At
present, artemisinin derivatives cannot be recommended in the first trimester of pregnancy.
However, they should not be withheld if treatment is considered life saving for the mother, and
other suitable antimalarials are not available. For dosage of quinine, see section on treatment
of severe malaria.

                             S: Clindamycin dosage: 10mg/Kg (O) twice daily for 7 days.
Note: Lactating women should receive the recommended antimalarial treatment (including ALu)

4.2 Management of severe malaria in pregnancy

Pregnant women infected with malaria are more susceptible to develop severe malaria.
They commonly present with one or more of the following signs/symptoms: high fever,
hyperparasitemia, low blood sugar, severe haemolytic anaemia, cerebral malaria, pulmonary
oedema.

The management of severe malaria in pregnant women does not differ from the management
of severe malaria in other adult patients, except pregnant women in the first trimester. (See
section on Treatment of Severe Malaria).

The risk of quinine induced hypoglycaemia is greater in pregnant than non-pregnant women.
Blood sugar should be monitored regularly and if falls below 2.5 mmol/L (< 45
mg/dl) give IV 10% or 25% dextrose. While the patient is on IV Quinine treatment, pay

299 | P a g e
particular attention to the feeding of the patient.

4.3 Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp)

The drug of choice for IPTp is Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine (SP). SP remains the drug of
choice for IPTp even though it is no longer the first line drug for malaria treatment. This is
because the aim of IPTp is to prevent the worst effects of infection, rather than to cure a
potentially life threatening illness. As such, lower efficacy antimalaria is acceptable for IPTp
than for curative purposes. It is particularly important that drugs used in pregnancy are known
to be safe. It is also likely that drugs with a long half-life are the most effective when used as
IPTp.
The first IPTp dose is administered between 20-24 weeks of gestational age. The second IPTp
dose should be administered at 28 ­ 32 weeks.
NOTE:

     IPTp should be administered as direct observed treatment (DOT) during an antenatal
         care visit

      Treatment or intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine should not be
          given to HIV-infected patients receiving cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole)
          prophylaxis.

                     TUBERCULOSIS AND LEPROSY

1.0 TUBERCULOSIS

Tuberculosis is chronic airborne infection caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis also known
acid fast baccili; less frequent it can be caused by mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium
africanus. It is a public health problem and all cases must be notified to the MoHSW.

Sings and symptoms
              Cough of more than two weeks
              Fever
              Excessive Night sweats
              Haemoptysis(sputum mixed with blood stains)
              Loss of weight

Types of Tuberculosis
     Pulmonary TB : Its most common and infectious affecting the lungs
     Extra pulmonary TB: occurs when bacteria spread outside the lung to cause damage in
         any organ such as meninges, lymphnodes, kidneys, spine, intestinal and ostearticular. it
         common among people with HIV/AIDS

Control of Tuberculosis
Important key points are:

     Treatment should be short, effective and provided free of charge
     TB services should reach all areas, integrated in PHC system and ensure widespread use

         of BCG vaccination and case finding (especially sputum positive patients)
     Priority should be on identifying and treat all infectious TB cases

Prevention
BCG vaccination is given at birth or at first contact with the child after birth. It is given
intradermally on the right upper arm, above the insertion of the deltoid muscle.

NOTE: The batch number of the vaccine and the date has to be recorded on the antenatal
card, dosages are recommended by EPI programme. BCG should be give to all babies having
clinical signs of HIV infection

Non-healing ulcers after vaccination with BCG (up to 8 weeks) or regional lymphadenopathy can
be treated with:

Isoniazid (O) 10 mg/kg once daily for two months

Case Management

301 | P a g e
Diagnosis
Sputum: Each patient should have direct smear microscopy (DSM) on two sputum specimens
for diagnosis. DSM should be repeated at the end of the intensive phase to confirm sputum
conversion. Sputum of TB patients MUST be sent or taken to the TB Reference Laboratory
when:

          Sputum conversion to negative has not taken place
          There is concern that the patient has developed drug resistance
          All re-treatment and treatment failures
          Culture and sensitivities are required.

         Chest X-rays: This has to be done upon
          Smear negative TB cases

The diagnosis of TB in children can be very difficult owing to the wide range of symptoms.
Sputum cannot often be obtained from children and in any case it is often negative even on
culture. Symptoms in children are not typical. The diagnosis should therefore be based on
clinical findings, family history of contact with a smear positive case, X-ray examination and
tuberculin testing, culture (if available) and non-response to broad spectrum antibiotic
treatment. A score chat below can help to reach the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Older children
who are able to cough up sputum should go through the same assessment as adults using
smear microscopy as the "gold standard".

         Tuberculin Testing
         The tuberculin skin test is valuable as a diagnostic tool in children, in child who did not
         receive a BCG vaccine an induration of 10mm or more interpreted as positive, if a child
         did receive a BCG, the induration should be at least 15mm to be positive

         These results may indicate:
          Active infection (especially when strongly positive)
          Previous infection or
          Previous BCG

NOTE : Absence of a response does not exclude TB because individuals with HIV may not
have sufficient immunity for a positive Mantoux test despite active TB

2.0 TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS IN SPECIAL CASES

2.1 Pregnancy: Always ask a woman if she is pregnant before commencing treatment, most
of anti-TB is safe during pregnancies except streptomycin, which causes permanent deafness in
the foetus therefore it should be avoided during pregnancy

2.2 Breastfeeding: Full TB treatments are safe and are best way to prevent tuberculosis in
the baby mother and child can stay together for the entire duration of treatment. In the
mothers with pulmonary tuberculosis, the baby should receive INH preventive (5mg/kg) for
6months followed BCG vaccination

2.3 Oral contraceptives: Rifampicin interacts with oral contraceptives and reduces the
efficacy of this contraception. Women using contraceptive should be adviced to use pills with
higher dose of oestrogen (50mcg) or change to another method

306 | P a g e
2.4 Liver disease: Most of anti-TB can cause liver damage. In case a patient develops
jaundice, treatment should be stopped and restarted as soon as the jaundice resolves. In
severely ill patients start streptomycin and ethambutol only. If the patient improves follow with
a gradual step up introduction of isoniazid followed by rifampicin until full dose. Monitor liver
functions and clinical picture. If the condition deteriorates stop the drug which was added.
Patients with established chronic liver disease should not receive pyrazinamide.

2.5 Renal failure; Isoniazid, Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide are almost entirely excreted by the
liver and therefore safe to use. Streptomycin andEthambutol are excreted by the kidneys and
should either be avoided or given in a reduced dose. The safest regimen for patients with renal
failure is 2 RHZ/4 RH combined with pyridoxine to prevent Isoniazide induced peripheral
neuropathy.

2.6 HIV/AIDS: There is a danger of interaction between Rifampicin and protease inhibitors in
HIV positive patients receiving antiretoviral (ARV) treatments. Rifampicin stimulates the activity
of the liver enzyme system, which metabolises protease inhibitors (PI) and Nucleoside Reverse
Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs). This can lead to decreased blood levels of PIs and NsRTIs. Of
the NsRTIs the concentration of Nevirapine is significant reduced and hence Nevirapine and
Rifampicine should not be used concomintantly. On other hand PIs enhance the liver enzyme
system which influences the blood levels of rifampicin resulting in ineffective TB treatment or
drug toxicity. NRTIs can cause peripheral neuropathy, which can result in an added toxicity
caused by Isoniazid.

2.7 The role of adjuvant steroid therapy
Steroid therapy given in additional to anti-TB treatment is beneficial in tuberculosis meningitis,
pleural TB with large effusion and TB pericarditis. The recommended dosage in TB meningitis
and TB pericarditis is 40-60mg/daily for 1 ­ 4 weeks, gradually decreasing the dosage over
several weeks.Other less frequent conditions, which can benefit from steroid treatment, are:

     TB laryngitis with airway obstruction
     Massive lymphadenopathy with signs of obstruction of e.g airway
     TB of renal tract to prevent uretetic scarring
     Tb of adrenal glands causing hypo-adrenalism
     Severe hypersensitivity reaction to anti-TB drugs

         Although steroids are immunosuppressant they can be used in HIV positive patients as
         the overall benefit of steroids, in the context of above conditions, outweighs the risk of
         other opportunistic infections.

2.8 Multi drug resistance Tuberculosis
MDR TB is a laboratory diagnosis confirmed after culturing Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains
and performing drug susceptibility tests (DST). Resistant strains will be identified because they
will be able to survive exposure to anti TB drugs which were previously toxic to them. Four
different categories of drug resistance have been identified:

     Mono-resistance: Resistance to one anti-tuberculosis drug

     Poly-resistance: Resistance to more than one anti-tuberculosis drug, other than both
         isoniazid and Rifampicin (e.g. against both pyrazinamide and isoniazid)

     Multidrug-resistance: Resistance to at least isoniazid andrifampicin

307 | P a g e
     Extensive drug resistance TB (XDR-TB): Multidrugresistance with additional resistance
         to any fluoroquinolone, and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs
         (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin).

Diagnosis of MDR -TB
The required baseline investigations of any DR TB suspect include:
· Comprehensive medical history including outcomes of prior TB treatment
· Physical examination
· Collection of 2 sputum samples (spot ­ morning) for smear microscopy, culture and DST
· Provider Initiated Testing and Counseling (PITC) for HIV
· Education on cough hygiene
· Chest X-ray examination

DST confirmed MDR TB patients shall be referred and transported by a special ambulance to
the MDR TB Hospital where they will be admitted.

Treatment of MDR ­TB
Standardized treatment: Regimens are designed according to representative Drug Resistance
Well-defined patient populations. All patients in a patient group or category receive the same
regimen.Suspected MDR TB should be confirmed by DST whenever possible.

Standardized MDR TB treatment regimen for Tanzania:
6Z Amk (5) Ofx Eto Cs±E /12Z Ofx Eto Cs±E

Intensive Phase (minimum 6 months, or 6 months postculture conversion)
     Amikacin or Kanamycin
     Ofloxacin or Levofloxacin
     Pyrazinamide
     Ethionamide
     Cycloserine
     Ethambutol

Continuation Phase (minimum 12 months or 18 months post culture conversion)
     Ofloxacin or Levofloxacin
     Ethionamide
     Pyrazinamide
     Cycloserine
     Ethambutol

2.9 Management of TB/HIV co ­infections
     HIV is the highest known risk factor for developing TB
     HIV promotes progression to active TB in people with both recently acquired and latent
         M. Tuberculosis
     All patients with TB should be screened and managed for HIV

Reducing the burden of HIV in TB patients
     All patients with TB infection should be counselled and tested for HIV
     All TB patients should be given health education HIV prevention methods

308 | P a g e
     All TB patients co ­ infected with HIV should be given cotrimoxazole preventive
         therapy(CPT)

     All TB/HIV patients with CD 4 less than 200 cells treat TB first for at least two months
     TB/HIV patients with CD 4 less than 50cells/ul treat anti -TB for atleast two weeks

         before initiation of ARVs

3.0 LEPROSY

It is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by mycobacterium leprae, an acid and alcohol fast
bacillus that has a very slow multiplication. It mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves and
the mucous memberanes. It is a disease mainly of human beings, which affects people of all
races, all ages and both sexes. Leprosy is the commonest cause of peripheral neuritis in the
world.

Patients harboring many bacilli in their bodies, the multi bacillary patients, are the main sources
of infection. If not treated, they spread the disease in the community and infect others through
coughing and sneezing (droplet infection). These infectious patients represent only about 25%
of the registered leprosy patients in Tanzania. The other 75% of patients with few leprosy
bacilli, the paucibacillary patients are less infectious. Skin contact with leprosy patients is no
longer considered to be an important means of transmission. The different manifestation of
leprosy is due to differences in the degree of resistance (immunity) of the human body and not
due to different kinds of bacilli.

The majority of people (about 85%) have a strong resistance to M. Leprae that even when
infected they do not develop the disease. About 75% of children who get infected with leprosy
bacilli have such a high resistance that they overcome the disease themselves, without
treatment, at very early stage. People who have a fairly high but incomplete immunity to
leprosy bacilli will develop paucibacillary leprosy. There are only very few people in the
community (5-10%) whose immunity to M. Leprae is naturally very low. When somebody form
this group of people is infected by M.Leprae, the bacilli may multiply freely and attain large
numbers causing multi-bacillary leprosy.

Diagnosis
The major clinical features therefore include hypopigmented anaesthetic macula or nodular and
erythematous skin lesions and nerve thickening. Patients should be suspected of having leprosy
when they show one or more of the following signs of symptoms:

     Burning sensations in the skin
     Pale patches on the skin with loss of feeling
     Numbness and tingling of the feet and/or hands
     Weakness of eyelids, hands or feet
     Tender nerves
     Painless swellings or lumps in the face and earlobes
     Painless wounds or burns on the hands or feet
Note:
     Patients presenting the above symptoms need to be examined by the District TB and

         Leprosy Coordinator at the earliest possible time. The DTLC will examine the patient and
         will decide whether or not to put him on treatment.
     The diagnosis of leprosy must be based on the history of the symptoms and careful
         clinical examination of the person for signs of the leprosy. Only rare instances a

309 | P a g e
         laboratory and other investigation may be needed to confirm diagnosisi of leprosy, if one
         is not sure, the suspect should be seen by the DTLC or other person trained in leprosy
     The three cardinal signs of leprosy are:

              o Skin patch with loss of sensation
              o One or more enlarged peripheral nerves
              o The presence of leprosy bacilli

History taking
Proper history taking and collection of certain information on the patient are very important for
understanding the patient's situation and for tracing a lost patient. The following must be
obtained:

     General information: all three names, sex, year of birth, full address form home to clinic,
         ioccupation

     Contact information: other leprosy cases in the patient's household
     Main complaints, including date of onset, site of first lesions, subsequent changes and

         development received.

Physical examination
     Physical examination should always be carried out with adequate light available and with
         enough privacy for the person to feel at ease.
     The patient is asked to undress. To ensure that no important sign is missed, a patient
         must be examined systematically. A well tried system is to examine the patient as
         follows:
              o Start with examination of the skin, first head, then neck, shoulders, arms, trunk,
                   buttocks and legs
              o Then palpation of the nerves; starting with the head and gradually going to the
                   feet
              o Then the examination of other organs
              o Examination of the skin smear
              o Finally the examination of eyes, hands and feet for disabilities.

Complications due to nerve damage
Patients should be examined for the following complications which result from nerve damage:

     Injury to cornea and loss of vision due to incomplete blink and/or eye closure
     Skin cracks and wounds on palms and soles with sensation loss
     Clawed fingers and toes
     Dropfoot
     Wrist drop
     Shortening and scarring gin fingers and toes with sensation loss. Mark and draw also

         wounds, clawing and absorption levels on the maps using the appropriate marks.

Note: A diagnosis of leprosy should be made if ONE of the following CARDINAL SIGNS is
presents

     Skin lesion with the loss of sensation
     One or more enalarged peripheral nerves
     A skin smear positive for leprosy bacilli

Classification of Leprosy

310 | P a g e
The main purpose of classification is to decide on the treatment regimen to be given to the
patient. Leprosy is classified into two groups depending on the number of bacilli present in the
body. Patients considered to harbor many bacilli belong to multibacillary (MB) group, with few
bacilli form the paucibacilary (PB) group. Classification is also important as it may indicate the
degree of infectiouness and the possible problems of leprosy reactions and further
complications.

There are two methods of classifying leprosy, based on:
     The number of leprosy skin lesions
     The presence of bacilli in the skin smear
    Skin smear is recommended for all new doubtful leprosy suspects and relapse or return to
    control cases.

Classify the patients as follows:

4.0 MULTIBACILLARY (MB) LEPROSY

     Patients with six or more leprosy skin lesions
     Positive skin smear
Paucibacillary (PB) Leprosy
     Patients with one to five leprosy skin lesions
     Negative skin smear

If there is any doubt regarding the classification, the patient should be classified and treated as
a multibacillary case. This certainly applies to patients who have been treated in the past and of
who insufficient information is available on the treatment previous used.

Treatment
Multiple drug treatment (MDT) is recommended treatment for leprosy. MDT is the combination
of minimum two anti- leprosy drugs. Treatment of leprosy with only one drug monotherapy will
result in development of drug- resistance, therefore it should be avoided. Patient having
multibacillary leprosy are given a combination of Rifampicin, Dapsone and clofezimine while
those having paucibacillary leprsosy are given a combination of Rifampicin and Dapsone. Both
regimens are given in the form of blister pack on a four weekly basis. A patient takes a first
dose under direct observation of health worker. For the following 27 days, the patient takes the
medicines at home under observation of treatment supporter.

         patient who has missed 8 doses of MDT in total and hence cannot complete the 12
         doses within 18 months, should be recorded as defaulter
     When a defaulter report at a clinic, a second course of MDT should be started after the
         importance of regular treatment has been discussed with the patient
     Patients who restart the treatment must be registerd into the unit register District
     Leprosy Register again with a new number as return after default and thus should be
         included in another treatment cohort for assessing completion of treatment
     Every effort should be made to ensure that patients complete the second course of MDT
         as recommended
     After completion of the second course of MDT the patient should be recorded as
         treatment completed

Treatment in special cases

Pregnancy: The standard MDT regimens are considered safe, both for mother and child and
should therefore be continued during pregnancy.

Tuberculosis: Patients suffering from both tuberculosis and leprosy require appropriate anti-
tuberculosis therapy in addition to the MDT. Rifampicin must be given in the dose required for
the treatment of tuberculosis. Once the intensive phase of anti TB treatment is completed, the
patient should continue with his/her monthly rifampicin for leprosy treatment.

HIV/AIDS: The management of a leprosy patient infected with HIV is the same as that for any
other patient. The response and cure rate of HIV positive patient is the same as in other
patients. The management, including treatment reactions, does not require any modifications.

Leprosy Reactions and Relapse
Leprosy reaction is sudden appearance of acute inflammation in the lesions (skinpatches,
nerves, other organs) of a patient with leprosy.This is due to an alteration in the immunological
status of the patient. Reactions are the major cause of nerve damage and disability in leprosy.
Therefore should be detected early and treated. Leprosy reactions are of natural cause of the
disease and can occur at any time.Reaction commonly occurs during the early stage of disease.
Sometimes patients report for first time to a health facility because of leprosy reaction. Some
reactions are seen after completion of the treatment.

There are two types of reactions
     Reverse Reaction(RR) or type I reaction
     Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) or type II reaction (For detail refer Manual for
         management of Leprosy for Health Workers)

Treatment of Reversal Reaction or Type I Reaction
Depending on severity, treatment of RR is by giving anti- inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids
usually prednisolone for a prolonged period.

313 | P a g e
Standard treatment of Severe Reversal Reaction with Prednisolone
40 mg daily (8 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 40mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
30 mg daily (6 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 30mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
20 mg daily (4 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 20mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
15 mg daily (3 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 15mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
10 mg daily (2 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 10mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks
5 mg daily (1 tablet of 5mg or 1 tablet of 5mg Prednic pack) 2 weeks

Treatment of severe Reversal Reaction with Prednisolone at Hospital level
60 mg daily (12 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 1 week
50 mg daily (10 tablet of 5 mg prednisolone) 1 week
40 mg daily (8 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks
30 mg daily (6 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks
20 mg daily (4 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 10 weeks
15 mg daily (3 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks
10 mg daily (2 tablets of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks
5 mg daily (1 tablet of 5 mg prednisolone) 2 weeks

Treament for Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) or Type II reaction
Erythema Nodosum Leprosum occurs only in multibacillary leprosy patients.An estimated 5 to
10% of MB patients develop ENL reaction. It is caused by an interaction between dead M.leprae
and substances 2accumulating in the blood and tissues. The reacton is often triggered by
special circumstances like emotional stress, pregnancy or childbirth, infectious diseases
(malaria, TB), etc

Mild Erythema Nodosum Leprosum: Advice the patient to rest and provide anagelsics such
as aspirin (600mg three times a day) and chloroquine if available (150 mg two times daily), for
one week duration .Re-examine the no improvement after six weeks with analgesics or signs of
a more severe ENL reaction occur, use prednisolone.

SevereErythema Nodosum Leprosum: Refer the patient to the nearest hospital for
appropriate examinations and treatment. Prednisolone is given for three weeks as per schedule
shown below.

Recurrent Erythema Nodosum Leprosum
A few patients get regular episodes of ENL as soon as the dose of prednisolone come below 20
or 15 mg per day.This is called chronic or recurrent ENL. Patients with recurrent ENL should be
referred to hospital.

          SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STI)

1.0 General guidelines

Accurate laboratory-proven diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STI) is not always
possible except in a few health facilities with well equipped functional laboratory services. For
health facilities without laboratory services, one must treat on clinical grounds i.e treat a
disease based on suspected causative agents diagnosed clinically or by syndromic approach. In
syndromic approach clinical syndromes are identified followed by syndrome specific treatment
targeting all causative agents which can cause the syndrome. Contact tracing is encouraged as
an important means of preventing further spread. Appropriate health education should be
given at every opportunity.

First line therapy is recommended when the patient makes his/her first contact with the
health care facility
Second line therapy is administered when first line therapy has failed and reinfection has
been excluded.
Third line Therapy should only be used when expert attention and adequate laboratory
facilities are available, and where results of treatment can be monitored.

In order to ensure complete cure, doses LESS than those recommended must NOT be
administered. The use of inadequate doses of antibiotics encourages the growth of resistant
organisms which will then be very difficult to treat.

Accurate laboratory-proven diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STI) is not always
possible. The treatment recommended in this section is based on diagnosis of STI associated
syndromes. Contact tracing is encouraged as an important means of preventing further spread.
Appropriate health education should be given at every opportunity.

2.0 Reasoning in Choosing STI Drug Treatment Regimens

In choosing STI treatments, high efficacy (cure rate >95%) is most important. There is
increasing evidence (clinical and now laboratory confirmation) that some of the first line drugs
in these treatment protocols are below acceptable levels of effectiveness. This is particularly
the case for chancroid and gonorrhea. New drugs have been introduced for these conditions,
but are currently advised as second line and third line.

9.0 WARTS

9.1 Genital Warts

These are usually caused by papilloma group of viruses infecting the skin or mucous
membrane. The common sites affected by warts include genital region (condylomata
acuminata) hands and legs. The lesions are usually asymptomatic fleshygrowths. In the genital
region, lesions are often finger like and increase in number and size with time. When extensive
they may interfere with sexual intercourse and child birth. The
removal of the lesion does not mean cure of the infection.

Treatment
                   C: Podophyllin10-25% to the warts, and wash off in 6 hours, drying
                             thoroughly.
                                       OR
                   C: Silver Nitrate to the warts, and wash off in 6 hours, drying thoroughly.
                                       OR
                   C: Salicylic acid to the warts, and wash off in 6 hours, drying thoroughly.

Treat every 2-3 days until warts are gone.

Alternatively
                   S:5% Imiquimod cream with a finger at bedtime, left on overnight, 3 times a

        week for as long as 16 weeks.

The treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6-10 hours after application.
Surgery may be useful in selected cases to remove the warts.
Note: Do not apply on healthy surrounding skin.
CAUTION: It is contraindicated in pregnancy and lactation.

Cervical warts
This case should be refered to specialist /expert. Most expert advice against the use of
podophyllin for cervical warts; therefore apply imiquimod cream as above.

Meatal and urethral warts
Accessible meatal warts may be treated with podophyllin or povidone-iodine solution. Great
care is needed to ensure that the treated area is dried before contact with normal, opposing
epithealial surface is allowed.

10.0 TRICHOMONIASIS

It is caused by a flagellate protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis. It causes inflammation of vagina
and cervix in females and inflammation of urethra and prostate gland in males. Patient may be
asymptomatic or may present with a frothy green/yellowish discharge, itchness, erosion of
cervix.

321 | P a g e
Treatment
Adult:

                   A:Metronidazole 400mg 8hrly for 5 days
                   Children: 5mg/kg body weight every 8 hours for 7 days

                                       OR
                   C:Tinidazole 2gm stat
                   Children: 50-75 mg/kg single dose

                                       OR
                   D:Secnidazole 2gm stat.
Give the same treatment to partner. In pregnancy treatment with metronidazole should be
delayed until after first trimester.

11.0 VAGINAL CANDIDIASIS

It is caused mainly by candida albicans. Vulvae-vaginal Candidiasis is common in women on
the pill, in pregnancy and diabetics and in people on prolonged antibiotic courses. Vulvae
vaginal candidiasis is characterized by pruritic, curd-like vaginal discharge, dysuria and
dyspareunia. Disseminated Candidiasis; resulted from complications of the above, presents

                              CHAPTER TWENTY

          HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV)

The spectrum of disease due to HIV infection ranges from mild, non-specific conditions (e.g.
persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, herpes zoster, and seborrheic eczema) to its severe
form i.e. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Infection by the human
immunodeficiency virus leads to gradual and progressive destruction of the cell mediated
immune system. The clinical features may be due to HIV per se or as a result of immune
system destruction.

     Fever, diarrhoea, weight loss, skin rashes, sores, generalized pruritis, altered mental
         status, persistent severe headache, oral thrush or Kaposi's sarcoma may be found in
         patients with advanced disease
     Most patients, however, present with symptoms due to opportunistic infections e.g.
         tuberculosis, candidiasis or pyogenic infections.

1.0 TREATMENT OF HIV/AIDS IN ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS

HIV positive patients should be referred to Care and Treatment Clinics. The initial management
involves signing of the informed consent by the patient. Followed by a complete blood count,
renal and hepatic chemical function tests, urine pregnancy test and viral load where applicable
should be done at baseline. Initiation of treatment should be based on the extent of clinical
disease progression.
CD4+ T lymphocytes counts remain the standard for evaluating immune function.

1.1 Criteria of initiation of ART in Adults and Adolescents Patients

Based on experience and available evidence, use of ART improves quality of life and survival for
PLHIV. Optimal time of ART initiation is important for desirable health outcome in terms of
reducing risk of death, disease progression including tuberculosis and occurrence of serious
adverse events. WHO recommends that HIV infected patients to be initiated based on WHO
clinical stage and CD4 cells count level.
There are therefore 3 classes of patients that are eligible to begin treatment:

     All patients in WHO stage 3 and 4 clinical criteria, regardless of CD4 cell count
     All adolescences and adults including pregnant women with a CD4 count <

         350cells/mm3, regardless of clinical symptoms
     Special population including TB-HIV co-infection patients and those with chronic active

         hepatitis based on clinical and available laboratory findings, regardless of CD4 count

Note
Before initiating therapy in any patient, apart from clinical eligibility, it is important to assess the
patient's willingness and readiness to be on ART adherently.

1.2 Evaluation to be done before initiating therapy

Before initiating therapy in any patient, a good history of the patient must be taken and a head-
to-toe physical examination conducted. In addition the TB screening questionnaire should be
331 | P a g e
administered followed by screening. Thereafter, the following baseline laboratory tests are
recommended:

     Urinalysis
     Renal Function Tests (Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN))
     A complete blood count (If not available do Hgb)
     Chemistry profile for liver (serum alanine aminotransferase, ALT)
     Tests to rule out active TB where indicated (sputum AFB, CXR) in case of indication from

         the screening questionnaire
     CD 4 count (if it was not done in the past 6 months)
     Urine for pregnancy (To women of reproductive age)
     VDRL (when necessary)

The following could be done if available:
     Serum creatinine and lipids
     Hepatitis B and C serology
     Viral load

The patient and other family members (with patients' consent) should then be educated on
HIV/AIDS and the need to adhere to the agreed treatment plan.
General orientation of the patient and family members should include:

     Who to call and where to get refills
     Who to call and where to go when clinical problems arise
     Who to call/where to go for assistance on social, spiritual and legal problems that might

         interfere with adherence to treatment

1.3 First Line Treatment

Antiretroviral therapy both in naïve patients and those who have received treatment before
involves the use of a combination of drugs. Triple therapy consisting of 2 NRTI + 1 NNRTI or 2
NRTI + 1 PI or 3 NRTI's is recommended. It is important to remember that there is no single
combination that is best for every patient and/or that can be tolerated by all patients. Regimens
should be recommended on the basis of a patient's clinical condition, lifestyle, and ability to
tolerate the regimen.
CAUTION: The use of monotherapy in the treatment of HIV infection is prohibited.

The ARVs drug combinations should be used according to indications and contraindications that
govern the use of ARVs to minimize side effects and drug-drug interactions. The default first
line regimen in Tanzania is:

               Zidovudine (AZT) 300 mg/Lamivudine (3TC) 150 mg twice daily and Efavirenz
               (EFV) 600 mg once daily at night.

      For women in the child bearing age, Nevirapine (NVP) 200mg twice a day is given
      instead of Efavirenz.
Note
      For adolescents the dose of AZT is 200 mg BD for a body weight of between 20-40 kgs.

 For patients with <40kg the dose of EFV should be <600mg.

332 | P a g e
     Efavirenz has been reported to be associated with teratogenicity in early pregnancy and
         liver toxicity in children below three years. In these cases, Nevirapine should be
         prescribed instead.

     In women for whom effective contraception can be assured, EFV remains a viable option
         for the NNRTI component of the regimen.

Under certain circumstances however, the following regimens can be used as first line:

                    Zidovudine (AZT)+Lamivudine(3TC)+Nevirapine (NVP)

This regimen can be prescribed when Efavirenz is contraindicated, e.g. in Neuropsychiatric
complications of Efevirenz, in pregnancy and in children less than three years, and when
Tenofovir cannot be used such as in the presence of renal disorder and when haemoglobin is
stable.

Note: Nevirapine challenge dosing is required during the beginning of treatment. In the first
two weeks of treatment only half of the required daily dose of Nevirapine should be given, and
a full dose if there are no side effects such as skin rash or hepatic toxicity. In summary, this
means:

                   Zidovudine 300 mg/Lamivudine 150 mg/Nevirapine 200 mg in the morning +
                   Zidovudine 300 mg/Lamivudine 150 mg OD in the evening for the first 2 weeks.
                   And if there are no problems, THEN Zidovudine 300 mg/Lamivudine 150
                   mg/Nevirapine 200 mg twice daily.

                    Tenofovir 300mg / Lamivudine 300mg / Efavirenz 600mg

A triple FDC is available for use and the treatment of HIV/HBV co-infection.

                    Tenofovir (TDF) + Lamivudine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)

                    Tenofovir (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Efavirenz (EFV)

                    Tenofovir (TDF) + Emtricitabine (FTC) + Nevirapine (NVP)

The major concern with Tenofovir-based treatment is renal safety. Tenofovir-associated
nephrotoxicity is especially likely in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those
receiving other concomitant nephrotoxic medications, low birth weight, advanced age and lower
CD4 cell counts. Otherwise the overall rate of discontinuation for renal events is extremely low.
Renal function should be monitored through routine urine testing for the occurrence of
proteinuria and if available serum creatinine.

Note: For based Regimen
                     + Lamivudine (3TC) + Efavirenz (EFV)

                     +Lamivudine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)

Initiation
     New patients should not be started on Stavudine based regimen.
         NB: Stavudine can only be used when Zidovudine or Tenofovir is contraindicated

Continuation

333 | P a g e
     Stavudine can also be used for continuing patients, who are stable on stavudine regimen
         without any signs of side effects.

In cases where Nevirapine or Efavirenz cannot be used as a first line drug, a single drug from
the second line drugs can be used; for example LPV/r or ABC.

1.4 Changing Antiretroviral Therapy

There are multiple reasons which may prompt the need to change antiretroviral therapy. These
can be grouped into two major categories:

Drug adverse events ­Toxicities, including
     Intolerable side effects
     Drug interactions
     During pregnancy if the patient is on EFV.

Treatment failure or type of treatment failure
     Clinical failure ­ occurrence or persistence of HIV related OIs
     Immunological failure
     Virological failure

Changing antiretroviral therapy due to toxicity
From a clinical perspective, it is generally recommended that when changing a patient's
regimen due to toxicity, only the toxic drug(s) should be replaced, if possible. Table 8.3 below
provides guidance on ARV drug combinations with some common toxicity switches. It is based
on the first line drugs in the latest National HIV/AIDS treatment guideline.

 *Only if the patient is older than 3 years of age and weight  10kg or in a woman in

reproductive age.

 ** Follow liver function tests (LFTs) closely.

 ***Follow renal functions closely

1.5 Severity of adverse events due to ARVs

Side effects or toxicities caused by ARVs can be classified into three broad categories:
First category: Symptoms are mild and transient and often require patient assurance that
these symptoms are common and will decrease over time. These can be mild headaches, mild
gastric upset, nausea, fatigue and the CNS disturbances particularly with EFV. ARV interruption
is seldom indicated in this situation.

Second category: Symptoms are somewhat more severe and often respond to some medical
intervention. They include more severe gastric upset with nausea and vomiting, more severe
headaches and mild peripheral neuropathy that does not incapacitate or interfere with a
patient's lifestyle. These symptoms can often be successfully treated with anti-emetics, anti-
diarrhoea medicines, analgesics, neuroleptics (e.g. Amitriptyline) and other medicines. ARV
interruption is usually not indicated in this situation and often symptomatic treatment is only
temporary. The mild rash associated with NVP (dealt with under a separate paragraph below)
can often be treated with medical intervention.

Third category: Symptoms are severe such that ARV drugs must be stopped and replaced by
an alternative drug. These include anaemia (haemoglobin < 7.5 gm/dl or a falling haemoglobin,
that often drops by 2 gm/dl) as can occur with the use of AZT. Severe symptoms noted in the
first two categories can sometimes lead to the stopping of ARV due to severe toxicities such as
nausea with severe discomfort and minimal intake for 3 or more days, vomiting all in take in 24
hours or dehydration due to vomiting, severe headache not responsive to non-narcotic
analgesics, or fatigue reducing activity by more than 50%. In these situations, one or more
ARVs should be replaced by another. It also includes the hypersensitivity reaction to NVP which

335 | P a g e
can include a severe rash or liver function test (LFT) elevations to grade III or >5 times the
upper limit of normal range.

Nevirapine hypersensitivity reactions
NVP hypersensitivity reactions can manifest as a rash and/or elevated LFTs. The rash can occur
in up to 20 % of patients and usually occurs in the first 6-8 weeks of therapy. NVP will be
initiated at a lower dose for the first 2 weeks when only one NVP dose is given per day for 14
days. If there are no clinical signs or symptoms of a NVP hypersensitivity or allergy, the LFT
(ALAT) will be checked and the NVP dose will be escalated to 2 doses per day starting at the
second week.

Note:
     If a mild drug-reaction type rash occurs, patients will continue treatment with caution
         and careful monitoring. LFTs that are less than grade III (<5 times the upper limit of
         normal) can usually be followed until it is resolved. This rash will be treated with patient
         assurance, antihistamines and close follow up until resolved. NVP dose escalation will be
         delayed for up to one week until symptoms disappear. If symptoms worsen, this may
         indicate that the patient has severe hypersensitivity reaction and NVP will have to be
         stopped immediately and other medical interventions considered.
     If a severe drug-reaction type rash occurs e.g. severe erythema, urticaria, moistening of
         skin (desquamation), skin blistering, sloughing of skin, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema
         multiforme (when severe and involving the mucous membranes known as SJS),
         anaphylaxis, involvement of mucous membranes, angioedema, cracked/fissured lips, or
         systemic signs (body aches, arthalgias, myalgias, fevers, lymphadenopathy or
         significantly elevated LFTs); patients will discontinue NVP treatment, begin high dose
         prednisolone, antihistamines, analgesics, and be admitted to the hospital for IV fluids
         and careful monitoring.. NVP will be stopped immediately and not re-introduced.
         Continue with remaining two drugs for one week then stop all. Once the patient
         recovers, 3 ARV drugs will be started that do not include NVP. The remaining 2 ARVs will
         be paired with a replacement ARV such as EFV, if not contraindicated

Abacavir (ABC) hypersensitivity reactions
ABC hypersensitivity occurs in up to 5% of patients and can be fatal. Hypersensitivity symptoms
include: flu symptoms, shortness of breath, cough, fever, aches and pains, a general ill feeling,
fatigue/tiredness, swelling, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, muscle or joint aches,
numbness, sore throat or rash. ABC will be stopped immediately and not re-started if this
occurs.
Note: If there is a history of ABC hypersensitivity, then ABC is contraindicated.

Efavirenz (EFV) Side effects

EFV can cause CNS side effects such as vivid dreams, nightmares, vertigo, or confusion. These
symptoms are often mild and transient. Patients may benefit from assurance that these
symptoms are common and will decrease over time.

Stavudine (d4T) Side effects
Peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect with the use of Stavudine and occurrence of
lactic acidosis has been reported. Cumulative exposure to d4T has the potential to cause
disfiguring, painful and lifethreatening side-effects, such as lipodystrophy and lactic acidosis; for

336 | P a g e
patients who are still on d4T; prescribe 30 mg every 12 hours for all individuals, irrespective of
body weight. New patients should be started on AZT or TDF based regimen.

1.6 Changing antiretroviral therapy due to treatment failure

Treatment failure can be virologic, immunologic and/or clinical. It results from failure to
suppress viral replication with the development of viral resistance.
Virological Failure is defined if:

     There a less than 10 fold drop in viral load after 6-8 weeks of therapy, or when the viral
         load is detectable after 6months of therapy or when the viral load (VL) is persistently
         above 5,000 copies/ml..

Immunologic failure if defined as a:
      50% drop in CD4 count from peak value, or
      Return to pre-ART baseline CD4 count or lower.

Clinical failure results in disease progression which clinically may present with the development
of opportunistic infections or malignancy occurring 3 months or more after initiation of ART.

In Tanzania, immunological and clinical parameters are used to identify treatment failure.
However, in light of declining costs of performing viral load measurements, along with the
simplification of processes, where available, viral load parameters should also be applied. Where
available, Viral Load should be used to confirm immunological failure. Furthermore, clinical
failure must be distinguished from the Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS),
in that, while clinical failure is associated with failing CD4 counts, IRIS is associated with
improvements in immune response, i.e. CD4 counts.

1.7 Second-Line ARV Regimen

Before treatment failure is presumed and a particular regimen discarded, every effort should be
made to rule out causes other than drug resistance. Patients should be evaluated for
correctable factors, such as:

       Inappropriate dosing schedules
       Drug interactions that may reduce the efficacy of some of the ARV
       Non adherence due to side effects
       Evidence of malabsorption.
Each of the above scenarios could result in sub-therapeutic drug levels and poor clinical
response. In such cases, the regimen in question may be salvaged with palliative medication
and/or patient education. If clinical assessment indicates the presence of treatment failure due
to confirmed drug resistance, the best approach is to switch to an entirely new regimen,
choosing two or more drugs to which the patient is naive as the second line drug regimen.
Before changing to the second line drug regimen, the patient needs to go through the
treatment readiness and education process again. This needs to be carefully monitored as some
patients might hide their non-adherence.

1.8 Second-line antiretroviral therapy in adults and adolescents

Drugs used as the second line drugs in Tanzania include:
NRTIs

     Tenofovir (TDF)
     Abacavir (ABC)

                             PIus

337 | P a g e
     Lopinavir boosted by Ritonavir (LPV/r)
     Atazanavir boosted by Ritonavir (ATV/r)
The second line NRTI choice for adults and adolescents depends on the first line regimen. For
patients on AZT or d4T in first line, the default second line option is to use is TDF plus 3TC or
FTC combined with a ritonavir-boosted PI, either LPV/r or ATV/r. (TDF+3TC or FTC +LPV/r or
ATV/r)

If patients were started on TDF and had never used AZT regimen, the default second line
option will be AZT based regimen.

For patients who were initiated on TDF in first line because of intolerance to AZT and d4T, the
default second line option is to use ABC plus 3TC combined with a ritonavir-boosted PI, either
LPV/r or ATV/r. (ABC + 3TC + LPV/r or ATV/r)
Doses for these drugs are given in Appendix 4.
Note that LPV/r, TDF/3TC and TDF/FTC are currently available as FDC formulations which
simplify dosing and administration.

1.9 ART in Women of Childbearing Potential or Pregnant Women

The guiding principle for the treatment of women of childbearing potential or pregnant women
is that therapeutic decisions should be based solely on their need and eligibility for ART. The
recommended first-line regimen for this patient subgroup is: AZT + 3TC + NVP. However,
special circumstances of pregnancy or breast-feeding raise additional issues concerning toxicity
to mothers and children, the choice of ARV drugs, and the prevention of HIV transmission from
mothers to infants.

Women who are receiving ART and become pregnant should continue their treatment unless
they are in the first trimester of pregnancy and EFV has been part of the regimen, in which
case, EFV should be discontinued and replaced by NVP.

Note: ARV drugs have the potential to either decrease or increase the bioavailability of steroid
hormones in hormonal contraceptives. Thus, if a woman on ARV treatment decides to initiate or
continue hormonal contraceptive use, the consistent use of condoms must be recommended for
preventing HIV transmission. This may also compensate for any possible reduction in the
effectiveness of the hormonal contraceptive.

1.10 Antiretroviral drugs for non-ART naive patients

Treatment for patients who have been previously exposed to antiretroviral therapy should be
discussed with an authorized medical personnel before they are enrolled in the CTC and
(re)started on treatment.
Generally:

     Patients that are controlled on their antiretroviral medication at appropriate doses
         should continue on the same regimen if possible.

     Those who stopped for reasons other than treatment failure and for whom failure is not
         suspected, can restart the original regimen.

     Those known or suspected to have failed a previous regimen should be started on drugs
         they have not been exposed to before as appropriate.

338 | P a g e
1.11 Antiretroviral drugs for Intraveneous Drug users (IDU) on

Methadone Assisted Therapy

Drug use and addiction do not preclude successful ARV treatment. HAART is as effective for HIV
positive IDUs as it is for other people with HIV/AIDS. Given appropriate support, former and
active IDUs can adhere just as well as others and should have equal access to HAART. Special
attention should be paid to the particular needs of former and active IDUs when administering
ART, including those related to substance dependence, co-morbidities and co-infections. ART
might be started not earlier than 2 -3 months after starting Methadone assisted therapy. There
is an increased risk of interactions through cytochrome CYP450 3A between Nevirapine,
Efavirenz, Ritonavir and Methadone.

Give once daily regimen:
     Efavirenz(EFV) 600mg+Tenofovir (TDF) 300mg+Emtricitabine (FTC)200mg or
     Efavirenz (EFV) 600mg+Abacavir (ABC) 600mg+Lamivudine (3TC) 300mg
     Nevirapine(NVP) 400mg+TDF 300mg+FTC 300mg
     Nevirapine 400mg+ABC 600mg+Lamivudine 300mg.

Note:
     Efavirenz decrease Methadone plasma concentration up to 50% it requires constant
         methadone dose correction
     Nevirapine decrease methadone plasma concentration by up to 80% in addition

genetic barrier to resistance development. It's contraindicated in liver failure.

2.0 ANTIRETROVIRAL REGIMENS FOR HIV INFECTED INFANTS AND

CHILDREN

Most antiretroviral drugs approved for treatment of HIV infection can be used for children.
However, there may be limitations for young children requiring syrup or liquid formulations as
there some ART drugs that are not available in these formulations. Moreover, pharmacokinetic
parameters in children vary with age and therefore are more complicated than in adults. There
are some Paediatric FDCs now available. The use of tablets that require cutting in order to use
a portion of the drug should be discouraged as it can lead to under dosing or overdosing of the
drug. This in turn can lead to an increased risk of resistance or toxicity. Dosing in children is
usually based on either body surface area or weight. Drug doses must be adjusted as the child
grows in order to avoid risk of under dosage, resistance to drugs and sub optimal response.
Standardization is also important so that non-expert personnel can safely dispense correct

339 | P a g e
doses. It is therefore preferred to provide health care workers with job aids such as dosing
charts or dosing wheel that can be administered according to weight bands.
Criteria for Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy in Children (eligibility for ART) ­ Refer current WHO
clinical staging of HIV/AIDS)

2.1 Initiation of ART for Infants and children under 24 months

Initiation of ART is recommended for all children below 24 months of age who have a confirmed
diagnosis of HIV irrespective of WHO Paediatric Staging and irrespective of CD4 percentage or
CD4 count. For children less than 18 months old HIV­infection needs to be virologically proven
(using HIV DNA PCR, HIV RNA PCR). For children 18 months of age or older two positive
antibody test confirm HIV infection. HIV exposed and serological test positive children aged
less than 18 months with neither virological confirmation nor CD4 count or % available but who
meet WHO criteria for severe HIV disease (see presumptive diagnosis of HIV page 114)should
be initiated on ART. In such cases, HIV antibody testing must be repeated at age 18 months to
definitely confirm that the child is HIV infected. Only children with confirmed infection should
continue with ARV therapy.

2.2 Initiation of ART for Children 24 months or older

For children over 18 months of age, a positive antibody test is an indication of HIV infection
since any acquired antibodies from the mother would have degenerated, but needs to be
confirmed by a second serological test.. All children older than 2 years in WHO Paediatric Stage
3 or 4 HIV diseases should start ART irrespective of CD4 % or count and all children in Stage 1
or 2 with:

Breastfeeding and ART

The penetration of ARVs into human breast milk in lactating women has not been quantified for
most ARVs. Although some ARVs, such as Nevirapine, are known to be present in breast milk,
the concentration and quantity of drug that would be ingested by the infant would be less than
needed to achieve therapeutic levels. As a matter of fact infected breastfeeding infants whose
mothers are receiving ARV therapy may end-up with sub-therapeutic levels of some ARVs and
this could lead to development of drug resistance in the infant's virus. Thus, if a breastfeeding
infant requires ARV treatment, ARVs at standard pediatric doses should be initiated regardless
of whether the mother is receiving ARV therapy or not. There is no risk of ARV overdose or
toxicity in a breast feeding baby with a mother who is on ART.

Evaluation to be done before initiating therapy in children
A good history of the patient should be taken together with a thorough physical examination.
The following baseline clinical assessment should be done:

    · Weight, height, head circumference and other measures of growth
    · Clinical staging of HIV disease
    · Developmental status
    · Screening for malaria, TB disease, and exposure to TB
     Identification of concomitant medical conditions (e.g. hepatitis B or C infection, TB,

         other Co-infections or OIs, pregnancy in adolescent girls)
     Details of concomitant medications, including Cotrimoxazole and traditional or herbal

         therapies
    · Nutritional status, including assessment of the quality and quantity of intake
    · For those eligible for ART, assessment of the child's and caregiver's preparedness for

         therapy

Baseline laboratory tests
 Laboratory tests that should be done as shown in table 12 below

Treatment Using ARV Drugs in children
The guiding principles for antiretroviral treatment apply for children are the same as for
adolescents and adults. Any child irrespective of the age, diagnosed to be HIV infected should
immediately be referred to CTC. The initial management should include a complete physical
assessment and staging using WHO staging system as well as complete history including
possible exposure to ARV (i.e. for PMTCT or treatment). One objective is the evaluation for
presence of active Opportunistic infections.

Children under 2 years should be initiated on ART as soon as possible and waiting for results of
laboratory tests should not delay treatment initiation. The first line treatment options for
children are as follows in preferential order:
Less than 36 months of age:

     Zidovudine (AZT)+Lamivudine (3TC)+Nevirapine (NVP)
     Abacavir (ABC)+Lamivudine (3TC)+ Niverapine (NVP)
     Stavudine (d4T) + Lamuvidine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP

36 months or older and bodyweight 10kg or higher:

342 | P a g e
     Zidovudine (AZT)+Lamivudine (3TC)+ Efavirenz (EFV) or Nevirapine (NVP)
     Abacavir (ABC)+Lamivudine (3TC)+Efavirenz (EFV)or Niverapine (NVP
     Stavudine (d4T) + Lamuvidine (3TC) + Nevirapine (NVP)

Note: Stavudine (d4T) is an alternate for AZT in cases of anaemia (i.e. haemoglobin of
<7.5g/dl). However, it should be noted that d4T in liquid formulation needs refrigeration. Side
effects of Stavudine such as peripheral neuropathy are less common than in adults but this may
be because they are difficult to recognise in children. From age of 12 years onwards Tenofovir
(TDF) is the alternative drug for AZT and d4T.

Antiretroviral Drugs for ARV exposed children
If the mother received ARVs during pregnancy, either for her own treatment and /or to prevent
mother to child HIV transmission (PMTCT) , there is a possibility that she may transmit a
resistant virus to her baby. Resistance could also develop in the infant who has used ARV for
prophylaxis. This is particularly the case if NVP, either alone or as a component of a two-drug
regimen for PMTCT.
Children who require ARV therapy and who have previously received either single-dose NVP or
3TC or daily NVP while breastfeeding as MTCT prophylaxis should be given a PI based regimen.
If PI based regime is unavailable these children should be given the first line regimen available.
For dosing of ARV regimens see Annex 5, Peadiatric Antiretroviral Dosing.

Recommended Second-Line ARV Therapy for Infants and Children

The recommended second line regimen for infants and children are as follows:
     After failure on a first-line NNRTI-based regimen, a boosted PI( LPV/r) plus 2 NRTIs are
         recommended for second-line ART
     After a failure of first line of LPV/r + 2 NRTIs; NNRTI + 2 NRTIs is the recommended
         choice
     After failure on a first-line regimen of AZT or d4T + 3TC then ABC + 3TC is the
         preferred NRTI backbone option for second-line ART.

3.0 USE OF ARVS IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES

ART Eligibility for patient with TB/HIV CO-INFECTIONS?
ART should be initiated for all people living with HIV with active TB disease irrespective of CD4
cell count. TB treatment should be started first, followed by ART as soon as possible, within the
first 8 weeks of starting TB treatment. The recommended first-line ART regimens for TB
patients are those that contain Efavirenz (EFV), since interactions with anti-TB drugs are
minimal.

For those who are unable to tolerate or have contraindications to an EFV-based regimen, AZT
+3TC + NVP or TDF +3TC or FTC + NVP or a triple NRTI regimen e.g AZT+3TC+TDF is
recommended.
When using Nevirapine based regimen, the patient should be started on a normal dose (200mg
bd). Note: A leading dose is not required.

In individuals who need TB treatment and who require an ART regimen containing a boosted
protease inhibitor (PI), it is recommended to use Rifampicin and a boosted antiretroviral
regimen containing Lopinavir with additional Ritonavir dosing (LPV/r 400mg/ 400mg BID). This

343 | P a g e
regimen is associated with high levels of toxicity, and requires close clinical and laboratory
monitoring.

Treatment of TB for HIV Infected Children
In principle, TB treatment in children does not differ from that in adults. Nearly all pulmonary
TB in children is sputum smear negative (in most cases smear is "not done") or extra-
pulmonary tuberculosis and thus fall into category III. However, severe forms of TB such as
meningitis, miliary TB or TB of the spine should be defined as category I. Treatment can be
provided with adult formulation following the dose-body weight relationship presented. For
children with severe forms of TB, Ethambutol is recommended at a dose of 15 mg/kg
(2RHZE/4RH). The feared side effect of retro-bulbar neuritis is rarely seen in children taking
higher dosages exceeding 20 mg/kg for a long period of time. Nevertheless, if there is any
doubt, an alternative regimen (2RHZ/4RH) for young children can be applied.

BCG vaccination
In HIV positive neonates, BCG rarely causes disseminated infection of M. bovis and if it occurs it
should be treated with 2{RH}E/4RH. The WHO recommends that in countries with a high
prevalence of tuberculosis like Tanzania, BCG should be given to all neonates immediately after
birth, regardless of HIV status. The possible benefits of BCG outweigh the possible
disadvantages. However, BCG should not be given to children who present with clear signs and
symptoms of HIV-disease or AIDS.

4.0 HIV PREVENTION METHODS

The close association between TB and HIV infection necessitates that specific policies will be
needed to guide the nation in introducing and implementing HIV preventive services for all TB
patients.

Provision of Cotrimoxazole Preventive Therapy
TB patients who are co-infected with HIV are eligible to receive Cotrimoxazole prevention
therapy. Cotrimoxazole therapy is effective in preventing secondary bacterial and parasitic
infections.

                             A: Cotrimoxazole 960mg (O) once a day

Provision of Antiretroviral Therapy
Antiretroviral therapy improves the quality of life and greatly improves survival rates for PLHA.
High levels of adherence is required in order to achieve long-term benefits and minimise the
risk of developing drug resistance

Reduce the burden of TB in PLHIVs (3Is Strategies)
Since TB is a leading opportunistic infection among the causes of deaths in people living with
HIV, regular screening for TB to all PLHIV is crucial for success in reducing morbidity and
mortality of those living with HIV. According to the WHO 2004 the interim policy on
collaborative TB/HIV activities, strategies for controlling TB in persons with HIV infection should
include:

344 | P a g e
    Establish Intensified TB case finding (ICF)
    Intensified TB case finding involves screening for symptoms and signs of TB (TB screening tool)
    in settings where HIV-infected people are concentrated. Early identification of signs and
    symptoms of TB, followed by diagnosis and prompt treatment in people living with HIV/AIDS,
    their household contacts, groups at high risk for HIV, and those in congregate settings (e.g.,
    prisons, police quarters, military barracks, refugee camps, mining camps, schools, and living
    quarters for workers, especially labour-intensive agricultural areas), increases the chances of
    survival, improves quality of life, and reduces transmission of TB in the community

    Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT)
    TB disease develops in only 10% of all the individuals infected with M.tuberculosis. However, in
    HIV infected individuals this can be up to 50%.TB preventive therapy is an intervention that
    should be part of the package of care for people living with HIV. IPT is given to individuals with
    latent infection of M. tuberculosis in order to prevent progression to active disease. In these
    patients, the risk of developing tuberculosis is reduced by about 60% and their survival is also
    prolonged. Isoniazid is given daily for six to nine months and the protective effect is expected to
    last for 18 months. This therapy requires several steps to be taken, including identification of
    HIV-positive clients, screening to exclude active TB and monitoring of client' s adherence to
    treatment.

    Eligibility for TB Preventive Therapy among PLHAs
    For patients with no history of TB treatment:
 All HIV positive individuals with no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB and with positive
    tuberculin skin test are eligible for TB preventive therapy.
 A Tuberculin skin test should be offered to all HIV infected individuals where possible.
    For patients with history of TB treatment:
 Patients who had active tuberculosis in the past 2 years should not be considered for preventive
    therapy.
 Patients who were treated for tuberculosis more than 2 years earlier may be considered
    because they may have already been re-infected with TB.
 Patients who receive TB preventive therapy and who are eligible for antiretroviral therapy can
    complete their TB preventive therapy even if ART is started as there is no interaction between
    Isoniazid and the current ART regimen used.
    IPT should only be offered in the following situations:

         o Where quality supportive counselling is available
         o After effective screening for active TB
         o Where there is capacity for follow up and monitoring of patients to encourage adherence

              to preventive therapy
         o Where there is capacity to manage side effects and exclude active TB during IPT

                       OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS

1.0 Measles

Measles is caused by a paramyxovirus which is spread by droplet infection. The main clinical
features include fever and generalized maculopaular (Red rash appearing first behind the ears
and spreading to rest of body) plus any of the following: Cough, runny nose or conjunctivitis.
Others include lacrimation, photophobia, and copius nasal discharge, koplik spots, tearing and
eyelid oedema. It is rare at the age of less than 6 months. It is recommended that all children
should be vaccinated at the age of 9 months. .

Treatment
Adults:

               A: Paracetamol tablets 1g every 8 hours for 5 days
                                       Plus

               A: Vitamin A 200,000 IU orally
                                       Plus

               A: Tetracycline eye ointment 1% apply once daily for 7 days.
Children: Give Paracetamol 10-15mg/kg body weight every 8 hours for 5 days Plus Vitamin
A if less than 1 year give 100,000 IU stat and if over 1 year give 200,000 IU

         Note: Give extra fluid and food

2.0 Poliomyelitis

It is a rare cause of hypotonia with abrupt onset of weakness (often asymmetrical) in
association with a febrile illness. It is caused by one of the three related polio viruses, types 1, 2
and 3 which comprise a subdivision of the groups of enteroviruses. Clinical features of the
disease can be divided into three group's i.e.

     Non-specific febrile illness of 2-3 days duration without CNS involvement
     Aseptic meningitis include features mentioned above
     Paralytic poliomylitis ­ which is the major possible outcome of the infection but occurs in

         less than 10% of those infected.

Treatment guidelines
Give supportive therapy

Prevention
     This disease is preventable by immunization with polio vaccine starting at birth. Give 4
         doses at intervals of 4 weeks.
     Parents should be told about the World program to eliminate Polio and the importance of
         actively participating.

346 | P a g e
3.0 Viral Hepatitis

Viral hepatitis is a systemic infection predominantly affecting the liver. It is almost always
caused by one or another of the hepatitis viruses; A, B, C, and delta viruses. The clinical
spectrum of the disease due to viral hepatitis is variable. These ranges from asymptomatic and
inapparent to fulminant and fatally acute infections. Subclinical persistent infections with
hepatitis virus B and C may progress to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and possible
hepatocellurlar carcinoma.

Treatment guidelines
Treatment is mainly supportive; the condition can be self-limiting (healing on its own) or can
progress to fibrosis (scarring) and cirrhosis.

Prevention
Hepatitis types A,B and C are preventable by immunization. Vaccines for other types may
become available.

3.1 Hepatitis A

Essentials of diagnosis
Infection occurs in both epidemic and sporadic. Typical feature are:-
 GI upset (anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea).

347 | P a g e
 Jaundice, tender and enlarged liver.
 Abnormal liver function tests.
 Anti-HAV IgM elevated.
 RNA virus.
 Low social economical status (poor hygiene)
Mode of transmission: Mainly fecal - oral route.

Clinical presentation
 History of direct exposure to a previously jaundiced individual.
 Consumption of seafood or contaminated water.
 Initial non-specific symptoms usually precede the development of jaundice by 5-10 days.
 Fever, anorexia and epigastric pain are the usual symptoms.
 Darkening of the urine precede jaundice, which peaks in 1-2 weeks and then begins to

    subside.
 Tender hepatomegaly and jaundice are typically present; splenomegaly is variable.

Differential diagnosis
Before jaundice appears, the symptoms are those of non-specific enteroviral diseases
Note: Hepatitis mainly resolves spontaneously (95%) but rarely complicates into fulminant
Hepatitis that is fatal.

Lab investigations and findings
 A positive anti-HAV IgM indicates acute disease, where as IgG anti-HAV persist after

    recovery or chronic disease.
 The initial lab evaluation should include biochemical tests for hepatic inflammation and tests

    of liver function (ALAT,ASAT Bilurubin total and direct bilirubin Alkaline phosphatase),
 ALAT and ASAT level are elevated and roughly reflect the degree of parenchymal

    inflammation. Elevated alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamic acid and total and direct
    (conjugated) bilirubin levels are indicators of the degree of cholestasis, which may be a
    result of hepatocellular and bile duct damage.
 FBP, Leukocyte count is normal or low
 Hypoalbuminaemia, hypoglycaemia, and marked prolongation of prothrombin time are
    serious prognostic findings.
 Stool for macroscopic (consistance varies) and microscopic examination. (Parasitic ova,
    RBC's).

Treatment
Supportive treatment: For pain give paracetamol 15mg/kg /dose).
Prevention
General measures: Sanitation and hygiene that includes hand washing, proper disposal of
infectious materials.

3.2 Hepatitis B

Essentials of Diagnosis
     History of parenteral, sexual, or house hold exposure, maternal HBsAg carriage
     GI upsets,

348 | P a g e
     Jaundice,
     Tender hepatomegaly.
     Presence of HBs Antibody used to document recovery and/or immunity to HBV infection.

Mode of transmission
Mainly through parenteral, sexual and vertical transmission 5%

Clinical presentation
 The symptoms are non-specific, consisting only of slight fever (which may be absent) and

    mild gastrointestinal upset
 Visible jaundice is usually the first significant finding
 Dark urine and pale or clay-coloured stools
 Hepatomegaly is present
 Occasionally a symptom complex (caused by antigen-antibody complexes) of macular rash,

    urticarial lesion, and arthiritis antedates the appearance of icterus.

Lab investigation and findings
 To diagnose acute HBV infection, the HBsAg, and anti-HBs,
 Other investigations are like above with HAV infection plus alpha -1- ant trypsin, PTT
 Abdominal ultrasound when complication suspected.
Treatment

     Supportive
              o Low fat diet, oral fluids,
              o Give paracetamol (dose as above) if pain present

     Specific treatment
              o The use of interferon alfa in children has not yet established.
              o Lamivudine
                        o In children 2-11years-3mg/kg/once daily
                        o In children 12-17 years and adults-100mg daily

Note: Patient Receiving lamivudine for concomitant HIV infection should contimue to receive
lamivudine in appropriate dose for HIV infection

     Hepatitis B Vaccination and Prevention
There are two components for preventing hepatitis B:

    o Prevention of transmission of the virus
    o Immunisation

Immunization recomendations
Hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective, but should not be seen as an alternative to a strategy
of prevention of transmission.

3.3 Chronic hepatitis C infection
It is another cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and is transmitted by parenteral
routes. Acute infection is often milder than Hepatitis A with moderately raised transaminases.
Anti-HCV is positive.
Treatment

349 | P a g e
Interferon alfa: Usual dose: SC, 5­10 million units 3 times weekly for 4­6 months.

Category  Management

3.4 Hepatitis D virus (delta virus) infection occurs only in children coinfected with HB virus.

3.5 Hepatitis E disease is enterically transmitted, resembles infection with hepatitis A, but
most commonly affects young adults.

4. Rabies

Rabies is a zoonotic (transmitted from animals) viral neuroinvasive disease caused by a virus
that belongs to genus lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. It causes acute encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain) in warm-blooded animals. It is transmitted most commonly to
human by a bite from an infected animal but occasionally by other forms of contact. Rabies is
almost invariably fatal if post-exposure prophylaxis is not administered prior to the onset of
severe symptoms.

The incubation period of the disease depends on how far the virus must travel to reach the
central nervous system, may take one week to six months. Once the infection reaches the
central nervous system and symptoms begin to show, the infection is practically untreatable
and usually fatal within days.

Early-stage symptoms of rabies are malaise, headache and fever, later progressing to more
serious ones, including acute pain, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, depression and
inability to swallow water. Finally, the patient may experience periods of mania and lethargy,
followed by coma. The primary cause of death is usually respiratory insufficiency.

In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost always fatal after neurological symptoms have
developed, but prompt post-exposure vaccination may prevent the virus from progressing.

Management: Post Exposure treatment consists of local treatment of the wound, followed by
antirabies vaccine therapy (with or without rabies immunoglobulin) for contacts of category II
and III.

                                  Note 2: The World Health Organization recommends
                                     ID route of vaccination administration because it is cost
                                     effective.

For rabies-exposed patients who have previously undergone complete pre-exposure vaccination
or post-exposure treatment with cell-derived rabies vaccines, antirabies vaccines are given at
days 0 and 3 regardless of route of administration i.e ID or IM. Rabies immune globulin
treatment is not necessary in such cases. The same rules apply to persons vaccinated against
rabies who have demonstrated neutralizing antibody titres of at least 0.5 IU/ml.

5.0 VIRAL HEMORRHAGIC FEVERS
5.1 EBOLA
Ebola Hemorrhagic fever (Ebola HF) is a severe often fatal disease in humans and non-humans
(monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees). It caused by ebola virus of the family Filoviridae.

Transmission
The natural reservoir of the virus is unknown, the manner in which the virus first appears in a
human at the start of an outbreak has not been determined. Researchers have hypothesized
that the first patient becomes infected through contact with an infected animal. After the first
case-patient in an outbreak setting is infected, the virus can be transmitted in several ways:

              ­ Direct contact with blood or other secretions of an infected person (blood,
                   secretions, organs or other bodily fluids)

              ­ Exposure to Ebola virus through contact with objects, such as needles, that has
                   been contaminated with infected secretions.

              ­ Nosocomial transmission i.e. exposure to the virus has occurred when health
                   care workers treated individuals with Ebola HF without wearing PPE

              ­ Burial ceremonies where mourners have direct contact with the body of the
                   deceased person.

              ­ Through handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes- both
                   dead and alive

Incubation period
Incubation period is between 2 to 21 days. Infections with Ebola virus are acute. All age groups
are susceptible to infection. There is no carrier state.
Signs and symptoms start with sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain,
Headache and Sore throat. These symptoms are followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, impaired
kidney and liver functions.
In some cases; rash, red eyes, hiccups, both internal and external bleeding can occur.

Treatment
There is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for Marburg Hemorrhagic fever. However,
supportive hospital therapy should be utilized. These include:

              o Fluid and Electrolyte balancing
              o Maintaining oxygen status
              o Blood transfusion and clotting factors
              o Treat for any complicating infections.

5.2 Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever

Marburg is severe type of hemorrhagic fever which affects both animals and humans. It is
related to Ebola virus and a parent type belongs to Viral Hemorrhagic fevers of Filoviridae
family.

Mode of transmission
How the animal host first transmits Marburg virus to humans is unknown. However, humans
who become ill with Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus may spread virus to other people. For
example, persons who have handled infected monkeys and have come in direct contact with
their fluids or cell cultures have become infected. Spread of the virus between humans has
occurred in a setting of close contact, often in a hospital. Droplets of body fluids, or direct
contact with persons, equipment, or other objects contaminated with infectious blood or tissues
are all highly suspect as sources of disease. Transmission through infected semen can occur up
to seven weeks after clinical recovery.
Transmission does not occur during the incubation period.

Incubation Period
Incubation period is between 3-9 days. All age groups are susceptible but most case to adults.
Signs and symptoms are into two phases:
Phase One: Sudden onset of fever, chills, headache and myalgia.
Phase Two: Maculopapular rashes, Trunk rash, Nausea, Vomiting, Sore throat, Abdominal pain,

       Diarrhea, Jaundice, Pancreas inflammation, Severe weight loss
       Liver failure, Massive hemorrhage (all orifices), Multi-organ dysfunction, Delirium, Shock,
       and Death.

Prognosis
Case fatality rate of Marburg is between 23-25% (But the Angola situation the CFR was >90%)

Treatment
There is no specific treatment, cure, or vaccine for Marburg Hemorrhagic fever. However,
supportive hospital therapy should be utilized. These include:

353 | P a g e
              o Fluid and Electrolyte balancing
              o Maintaining oxygen status
              o Blood transfusion and clotting factors
              o Treat for any complicating infections.

5.3 Rift Valley Fevers

Rift Valley Fever is a viral zoonosis that primarily spread amongst animals by the bite of infected
mosquitoes. Rift Valley virus is a member of Phlebovirus genus in the family Bunyaviridae. A
wide variety of mosquitoes may act as vector transmission in different regions. Aedes
mosquitoes are the main vector biting animals. Transmission to human is mainly through direct
or indirect contact with blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to
human through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with
animal births, conducting veterinary procedures. The virus infects human through inoculation
e.g via wound from infected knife or through contact with broken skin or through inhalation of
aerosols produced during the slaughter of an infected animals. Human can also get infection
through infected mosquito.

Human become viraemic; capable of infecting mosquitoes shortly before onset of fever and for
the first 3­5 days of illness. Once infected, mosquitoes remain so for life.
Incubation period is between 2-6 days. Signs and symptoms are Influenza like illnesses: sudden
onset of fevers, headache, myalgia, backache neck stiffness photophobia and vomiting.
Meningoencephalitis and haemorrgic fever syndrome follow thereafter.

Most human cases are relatively mild small proportion develop a much more severe disease.
The total case fatality rate is less than 1%. Symptoms last from 4-7 days after which the
immune response to infection becomes detectable with appearance of IgM and IgG. And
disappearance of circulating virus from blood stream.

Treatment
There is no any established course of treatment of this disease.

Most of human cases are relatively mild and of short duration so will not require any specific
treatment.

Studies in monkeys and other animals have shown promise for ribavirin. Interferon, immune
modulators and convalescent phase plasma can also help.

5.4 Yellow Fever

354 | P a g e
Yellow fever is an acute viral infection that is transmitted to human through a bite of infected
mosquito-predominantly Aedes mosquitoes. It is caused by a virus that belongs to Flavivirus.
Though many cases of yellow fever are mild and self-limiting, the disease can also be a life
threatening causing hemorrhagic fever and hepatitis. It is endemic in equatorial Africa and
South America, with estimated 200,000 cases and 30,000 deaths annually. Overall case-fatality
rate in Africa 23%

Incubation period of 2-6 days and human become viremic - capable of infecting mosquitoes,
shortly before onset of fever and for the first 3­5 days of illness. Once infected, mosquitoes
remain so for life

Treatment, prevention and control

No specific anti-viral treatment, supportive therapies are recommended.
Prevention and Control involve mosquito control and provision of yellow fever vaccine.

Indication for Yellow fever vaccine:

    · persons  9 months of age
              ­ Planning travel to or residence in an endemic area
              ­ Planning travel to a country with an entry requirement

    · Needs to be given  10 days prior to arrival in endemic area
    · Revaccination at 10 year intervals

6.0 Expanded Program on Immunization

                    OTHER PROTOZOA INFECTIONS

1.0 Leishmaniasis

This group of diseases is caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. It can take two forms
i.e. generalized visceral infection (kala-azar) or a purely cutaneous infection (oriental sore).
Onset of kala-azar is shown by low grade fever, splenomegaly, enlarged liver and
lymphadenopathy. In the cutaneous form, single or multiple lesions are found on exposed
parts, from where Leishmania Donovan bodies can be demonstrated.

Treatment
Visceral/cutaneous leishmaniasis
First choice

                   C: Sodium stibogluconate 20mg IM/slow IVper kg body weight per day
                   for 30 days. Maximum dose 850 mg per day.

If parasites persist, treatment may be repeated, two to three times with a ten day interval in
between.

Second choice
                   C: Pentamidine Isethionate I.M at 2 to 4 mg/kg body weight every 48 hours
                   for a total of 10 injections.

Since an immediate hypotensive reaction may occur, patients should lie down during the
injection and adrenaline should be at hand. Pentamidine like Suramin is contraindicated in renal
disease. Further, due to possible nephrotoxicity, urine must be examined for albumin and/or
casts. The presence of either contraindicates continued use of pentamidine.

Children The same dosage as above
CAUTION: Close medical supervision is necessary during treatment

2.0 Trypanosomiasis

The causative organisms are the parasitic protozoa of Tryponosoma brucei gambianse and T.
brucei rhodesience. Clinical features include fever, lymphadenopathy and CNS involvement like
headache, mental confusion, tremors and pyresis. However for relevance in treatment, two
clinical divisions are noted, that is, there are patients with no CNS involvement and those with
CNS signs/symptoms.

Treatment Medicine of choice
Suramin is the medicine of choice for the early stages of African trypanosomiasis (T.b.g.)
before there is CNS involvement.

                   C: Suramin 20mg/Kg (to a max. of 1g in adults) (IV) given every week for 5 ­
                   6 weeks

357 | P a g e
Second choice
                   C: Melarsoprol 100mg (children 20 mg) I.V as a test dose then if there is
                   no reaction give 20mg/kg body weight single dose, freshly prepared (maximum 1
                   g) every 5 ­ 7 days.

NOTE:
· Usual course is 5 doses (do not exceed 7 doses or a total of 6 g)
· Suramin may cause renal toxicity therefore it is contraindicated in renal diseases
· Further, due to possible nephrotoxicity, urine must be examined for albumin and/or casts the
presence of either contraindicates continued use of Suramin.
In Trypanosomiasis due to T.b gambianse without CNS involvement the recommended drug is

                   C: Pentamidine isethionate freshly prepared 4 mg/kg I.M every 24 hours for
                   7 days (Max. 300 mg/dose).
CAUTION:
In patients with CNS involvement:
Start treatment with Suramin (day 1 and 2) for a total of two doses to clear blood of
trypanosomes in order to avoid a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction which will be precipitated by
destroying both CNS and peripheral trypanosomes by melarsoprol. Then give melarsoprol 3.6
mg/kg body weight in IV infusion dissolved in 200 ml of dextrose 5% given over a 2 hour
period for 3 consecutive days. The patient should lie supine during injection and for five hours
afterwards. The patient is then rested for 5-7 days and then the above regime of melarsoprol is
repeated. This is done once again after a further rest of 5-7 days, thus completing 3 courses of
melarsoprol. Blood film and CSF are then examined for trypanosomes.

                   OTHER BACTERIAL INFECTIONS

1.0 Anthrax

Anthrax is a disease of animals. However, man is infected directly through contact with infected
hides or inhalation of spores in the lungs or ingestion of infected meat. Hence it can be
cutaneous, pulmonary and/or intestinal. The main clinical features are itching, a malignant
pustule, pyrexia and rarely pulmonary and gastrointestinal signs.

Treatment
Medicine of choice

                   A: Benzylpenicillin. Adult0.6 MU I.V every 6 hours until local oedema subsides
         then continue with

                   A: Phenoxymethylpenicillin 250 mg 6 hourly for 7 days.

Children
Premature infant and neonate

                   A: Benzylpenicillin 6mg/kg body weight every 6 hours until local oedema
         subsides then continues with

                   A: Phenoxymethylpenicillin 62.5 mg 6 hourly for 7 days.
Infants (1-12 months)

                   A: Benzylpenicillin 75 mg/kg body weight daily 8 hourly until local oedema
         subsides then continue with

Children (1-12 years)

                   A: Benzylpenicillin 100 mg/kg body weight daily 6 hourly until 1 local oedema
         subsides. Then give

                   A: Phenoxymethylpencillin125-250mg6 hourly for 7 days

Second choice
                   A: Erythromycin (O) 500 mg 8 hourly orally for 10 days
                   Children:10 mg/kg body weight 8 hourly for 10 days

2.0 Mastitis (Breast Abscess)

Mastitis is an inflammation of the breast. The common causative organisms of the disease are
either staphylococcus or streptococcal bacteria. The breast becomes red, swollen and painful.
In breast abscess, there is a collection of pus in the breast. Clinical features of a breast abscess
are tenderness, swelling, red, warm, fever and painful lymph nodes. General: In mastitis stage
the treatment is antibiotics and antiflogistics. In abscess stage treatment is both surgical and
antibiotics.

Treatment

359 | P a g e
                   A: Erythromycin 500 mg orally on the first day then 100mg daily for further 6
                   days

                                       OR

                   C: Flucloxacillin500 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days in an empty stomach
                                       Plus

                   A: Acetylsalicylic acid 600 mg orally, after food, give every 6 hours (as needed).
         Instruct the patient to apply hot compresses and a constriction bandage to relieve pain
         in the affected breast, and to express milk if applicable to reduce engorgement.

3.0 Plague

Plague is a zoonotic systemic bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis, plague
bacillus) usually transmitted to humans by rodent fleas. The main disease forms are bubonic,
septicaemic and pneumonic with the former being the commonest. The incubation period is
within 7 days and case fatality rate may exceed 50 to 60% in untreated bubonic plague and
approaches 100% in untreated pneumonic or septicaemic plague.

Treatment
When preliminary diagnosis of human plague is made on clinical and epidemiological grounds:

     Subject the patient to appropriate antimicrobial therapy without waiting for definitive
         results from the laboratory.

     Use protective gears (gloves, face mask, and gowns) when managing a suspected
         plague case.

Specific treatment

a) Bubonic plague:

The drugs of choice are: - Doxycycline and Gentamycin

    (i) Doxycycline:

Adult and children aged 12 years and above:

Give100mg every twelve hours for 7 days

Do not use Doxycycline in children below 12 years and pregnant mothers

    (ii) Gentamycin:

    (a) Adults: Give 3mg/kg IM or IV every 12 hours for 7 days.
    (b) Children: Give 7mg/kg/day IM or IV every 12 hours for 7days

       Gentamycin is a drug of choice for pregnant women

360 | P a g e
    (iii) Chloramphenical (as alternative drug)
         Adults and children 1 year and above: Give 50mg/kg/day orally or IV every 6 hours for
         7 days

    (iv) Provide suitable analgesics
    (v) Use suitable antiseptics to dress wound in case of bursting of the bubo

CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS OF CONTACTS
Persons in close contact with pneumonic plague patients, or persons likely to have been
exposed to Y. pestis-infected fleas, to have had direct contact with body fluids or tissues of a Y.
pestis-infected mammal, or exposed during a laboratory accident to known infectious materials
must receive antibiotic preventive therapy.
Combination of drugs Co-trimoxazole (Septrin) is the most effective measure.

     (a) Adults: 2 tablets b.id for 7 days
     (b) Children: 1 tablet b.i.d for 7 days.
Other sensitive drugs to Y. pestis and those patients allergic to sulphadimidine should use
(Chloramphenical and tetracycline)

4.0 TICK BORNE RELAPSING FEVERS
Tick Borne relapsing fever is a bacterial infection characterized by recurring febrile episodes that
last for 3 days and are separated by afebrile periods of 7 days duration. Along with fever,
patients may experience a wide range of nonspecific symptoms. Each febrile episode ends with
a sequence of symptoms collectively known as a "crisis." During the "chill phase" of the crisis,
patients develop very high fever (up to 106.7°F or 41.5°C) and may become delirious, agitated,
tachycardic and tachypneic. Duration is 10 to 30 minutes. This phase is followed by the "flush
phase", characterized by drenching sweats and a rapid decrease in body temperature. During
the flush phase, patients may become transiently hypotensive. Overall, patients who are not
treated will experience 1 to 4 episodes of fever before illness resolves.
It is caused by spirochetes known as Borrelia duttoni. It is transmitted to humans by a bite of
soft tick infected by spirochetes known as ornithrodrous moubata. The incubation period is
within 2 weeks.

Treatment

361 | P a g e
Treatment involves antibiotics often tetracycline, doxycline erythromycin and penicillin. Procaine
penicillin G should be used when oral therapy is not tolerated.

     Chloramphenicol is administered at 500mg every 6 hrs for 7-10 days.
     Procaine Penicillin G is administered at 600,000 IU daily for 7 days
     In children younger than 8 years and in pregnant or nursing women erythromycin is

         preferred.

                       NUTRITIONAL DISORDERS

Nutritional disorders can be caused by an insufficient intake of food or of certain nutrients; by
inability of the body to absorb and use nutrients, or by over-consumption of certain foods. The
major nutritional disorders in Tanzania, in ranking order, are:

     Protein-energy malnutrition (deficiency of carbohydrates, fats, protein)
     Nutritional anaemia (deficiency of nutrients that are essential for the synthesis of red

         blood cells i. e iron, folic acid and vitamin B12)
     Iodine deficiency disorders (deficiency of iodine which is important for the synthesis of

         the thyroid hormones), and
     Vitamin A deficiency.

Other disorders do exist, though are of less public health significance. These include:
     Overweight/obesity
     Disorders associated with various vitamin deficiencies
     Disorders associated with deficiency of some trace minerals

1.0 PROTEIN-ENERGY MALNUTRITION (PEM)

This develops as a result of inadequate intake of carbohydrates, fats and protein. Deficiency of
some micronutrients, particularly iron and vitamin A, become partly responsible for the signs of
PEM. Infection also plays a role in the development of the features of PEM. The population
group most affected by PEM is children aged below five years. With regard to manifestation,
clinical and anthropometric features are distinguished:

1.1 Clinical forms of PEM

     Underweight ­ is moderate malnutrition. Casually the child may appear normal, but on
         close examination, the child looks thinner and smaller than other children of the same
         age. Oedema is absent.

     Marasmus ­ is severe malnutrition. The child shows remarkable failure of growth. He
         has very severe muscle wasting with flaccid, wrinkled skin and bony prominence. The
         child looks awake and hungry and displays what is referred to as `old person's face'.
         Oedema is absent.

     Kwashiorkor ­ is also severe malnutrition. There is failure of growth but the child is
         not as severely wasted as in marasmus. The abdomen is swollen (hepatomegaly due to
         fatty infiltration). The child shows hair changes (having turned brown, straight and soft)
         and rashes on the skin (flaky paint dermatitis). He is inactive, apathetic, irritable and
         difficult to feed. The child has bilateral oedema.

     Marasmic-kwashiorkor ­ is a condition combining severe wasting (marasmus) and
         oedema (kwashiorkor). The child has other clinical features characteristic of marasmus
         and kwashiorkor.

363 | P a g e
         [NB: Presence of oedema (of any grade) is considered severe malnutrition, regardless
         of the weight of the child].

1.2 Anthropometric features of PEM

PEM can be detected by use of anthropometry (body measurements). The following are the
anthropometric indicators commonly used in describing PEM: Stunting, wasting, underweight,
small body mass index (BMI) and small mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC).

     Stunting ­ is low height for age. It reflects failure to receive adequate nutrition over a
         long period of time and is also affected by recurrent and chronic illness.

     Wasting ­ is low weight for height. It reflects a rapid decline of weight while height has
         remained unchanged. Therefore wasting is acute malnutrition ­ a result of inadequate
         food intake or a recent episode of illness causing loss of weight and onset of
         malnutrition.

     Underweight ­ is low weight for age. This is a composite indicator which takes into
         account both chronic and acute malnutrition. That is, underweight is caused by either
         chronic malnutrition (e.g. long period of illness or not having enough to eat) or acute
         malnutrition (due to diarrhoea, infection etc).

     Low birth weight ­ is a reflection of intrauterine growth retardation. The WHO defines
         low birth weight as less than 2.5 kg. Causes include inadequate maternal food intake
         during pregnancy, short maternal stature and infection such as malaria. Cigarette
         smoking on the part of the mother also is associated with low birth weight.

         Table 1: Anthropometric features of PEM

Malnutrition condition Z ­ score (SD from median of the Diagnosis
                                        reference value)

Stunting, Wasting  or Below -3 SD               Severe
Underweight              -3 SD to below ­ 2 SD  Moderate

                   Below ­ 2 SD                 Total malnutrition

 Low BMI: BMI relates weight to the body's surface area and is derived as follows:
    weight (in kg) ÷ height2 (in meters). BMI thus provides a measure of the body

    mass, ranging from thinness to obesity. Categorization of BMI is as follows:

         Table 2:
364 | P a g e
BMI (kg/m2)               Diagnosis
Below 16.0                Severe under-nutriton (thinness grade 3)
16.0 ­ 16.9               Moderate under-nutrition (thinness grade 2)
17.0 ­ 18.4               Mild under-nutrition (thinness grade 1)
18.5 ­ 24.9               Good nutritional status
25.0 ­ 29.9               Overweight (overweight grade 1)
30.0 ­ 39.9               Obesity (overweight grade 2)
40 or above               Severe obesity (overweight grade 3)

Small MUAC: MUAC is the circumference of the left upper arm, measured at the mid-point
between the tip of the shoulder (acromium) and the tip of the elbow olecranon process). MUAC
is measured in cm; cut-off points are different for different population groups, as follows:

1.3 Management of PEM (under-nutrition)

Management of PEM varies with the form of malnutrition, severity of the condition and presence
or absence of medical complications. Most common medical complications in severely
malnourished children include generalized oedema, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, dehydration,
anaemia, septicemia/infections and cardiac failure. Management focuses on appropriate feeding
practices, nutritional supplements and treatment of any accompanying medical complications,
as follows:

     Acute malnutrition (wasting as well as underweight):
              o Severe acute malnutrition (SAM): If no medical complications, the patient should
                   be managed at home using ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF).
              o SAM accompanied by medical complications, the patient to be admitted for in-
                   patient care. Treat complications eg dehydration, shock, anemia, infections,
                   hypothermia, hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance. Give F75, F100 and
                   ReSomal, managed according to the standard guidelines - National Guidelines for
                   Management of Acute Malnutrition (issued by the MOHSW).
              o Patients aged five years or above, pregnant and lactating women ­ to be
                   managed at home using RUTF, also according to the existing standard
                   guidelines.

     Chronic malnutrition (Stunting): nutrition counseling emphasizing on adequate balanced
         diet and increased frequency of feeding. Accompanying diseases to be managed at
         health facility.

1.4 Overweight/Obesity

This is an increase of body weight as a result of excessive accumulation of fat in the body. In
some cases obesity occurs secondary to other disorders or conditions such as hypothyroidism,
Cushing's disease and others. Obesity may also occur due to prolonged use of medicines such
as corticosteroids. Body fat can range from 2 to 70 percent of the body weight. In this regard
men with over 24 percent body fat and women with over 35 percent body fat are considered
obese. Desirable amounts are 8 to 24 percent body fat for men and 21 to 35 percent for
women. NB: Women need more body fat because some sex-specific fat is associated with
reproductive functions. This fat is normal and is factored into the above calculations. Obesity is
associated with increased incidences of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, type II diabetes;
some types of cancer, certain bone and joint disorders and some digestive disorders.

    Anthropometric features of overweight/obesity

    For children under five years of age:

    Z score - +2SD - < +3SD = overweight
                 - +3SD and above = Obesity

366 | P a g e
Dietary and lifestyle measures

Nutrition counseling focusing on:
     Diet modification (less carbohydrates and fats, more fruits and vegetables).
     Less alcohol consumption
     More active life to increase energy expenditure (physical work, physical activities,
         exercises such as sports and gym)

2.0 ANAEMIA

Anaemia is a pathological condition arising as a result of low level of haemoglobin in the body.
Reduction of haemoglobin impairs oxygen transport to the tissues ­ the basis of the clinical
features of anaemia. Anaemia can be classified according to cause and mechanism of
development. Four major groups are distinguished:

     Haemorrhagic anaemia develops due to various forms of bleeding (trauma, excessive
         menses, bleeding associated with pregnancy and birth giving, and parasitic infestations
         such as hookworms and scistosomiasis).

     Haemolytic anaemia ­ due to massive destruction of red blood cells as occurs in
         malaria and sickle cell disease.

     Hypoplastic/Aplastic anaemia ­ due to failure of bone marrow to produce sufficient
         red blood cells. Bone marrow depression can be caused by diseases (autoimmune, viral
         infection), radiation and chemotherapy and intake of some drugs (anti-inflammatory,
         antibiotics).

     Nutritional anaemia ­ due to deficiency of the nutrients needed for the synthesis of
         red blood cells: iron, folic acid and vitamin B12. Nutritional anaemias are
              o Iron deficiency anaemia
              o Folic acid deficiency anaemia
              o Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia

Anaemia affects all population groups but children aged below five years and pregnant women
are the most vulnerable. Detection of anaemia is by determining the concentration Hb and the
cut-off points at sea level are as follows:

Table 4:

Population group                Hb levels indicating anaemia (g/dl)
Children 6 to 59 months         Below 11.0
Children 5 to 11 years          Below 11.5
Children 12 to 14 years         Below 12.0
Adult men (15+ years or above)  Below 13.0

367 | P a g e
Adult women (15+ years or above, non-pregnant)  Below 12.0
Pregnant women (regardless of age)              Below 11.0

Severity of anaemia:

     Hb 11.0 ­ 10.0 g/dl to the cut-off point = mild anaemia
     Hb  10.0 ­ 7.0 g/dl = moderate anaemia
     Hb < 7.0 ­ 4.0 gdl = severe anaemia
     Hb < 4.0 g/dl = very severe anaemia

Prevention of anaemia:

     Consumption of iron and vitamin rich foods. Iron in foods of animal origin (haem iron) is
         more easily absorbed compared with iron in foods of plant origin (which is mostly non-
         haem iron). Vitamin C enhances absorption of iron while tea and coffee inhibits iron
         absorption.

     Prevention and treatment of anaemia related diseases (malaria, worm infestation, other
         infections)

     Iron and folic acid supplementation to the most at risk groups ­ children, pregnant
         women, sickle cell patients (See National Guidelines for Micronutrient Supplementation)

     Use of micronutrients fortified foods (iron and folic acid included).

Iron Deficiency
The main function of iron is transport of oxygen at various sites in the body. Thus iron is a
component of haemoglobin and myglobin (protein molecule in the muscle which carries oxygen
for muscle metabolism). Iron is a component of cytochromes (involved in cell respiration);
component of xanthine oxidase (involved in catabolism of purines which make nucleic acids).
Iron is a component of aconitase (involved in the Krebb's Cycle) and many other enzymes such
as peroxidase and catalase.

While Hb concentration is used to define anaemia, it does not define the body's iron status.
Three stages are distinguished in the reduction of the body's iron status:

    1. Depletion of iron stores: the body's storage pool (deposits in the liver, spleen and bone
         marrow) diminishes due to insufficient dietary intake. This has no effect on the Hb yet.

    2. Iron deficiency erythropoiesis: storage levels substantially reduced, inadequate iron is
         available in the bone marrow for the synthesis of Hb. Still, no overt effect on the Hb
         level.

    3. Iron deficiency anaemia: last and most severe stage of iron deficiency ­ iron stores are
         insufficient to maintain Hb synthesis. Hb level decreases leading to anaemia.

368 | P a g e
Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Pallor
     Glossitis
     Fatigue
     Diziness
     Decreased mental alertness
     Anaemia (microcytic)

Dietary measures
     Rich sources of iron include meat (especially liver), poultry, fish, and seafood. These
         contain heme iron, which is easily absorbed in the gut.
     Others are fruits, vegetables, eggs, milk and dairy products, which contain non-heme
         iron. Absorption can be enhanced by vitamin C (taking meal with fruit).
     Use of foods fortified with iron
    NB: Certain substances (pytates in cereals and vegetables, tannins in tea and coffee)
    decrease iron absorption. Also when food is boiled in water iron is leached and is lost if the
    water is discarded.

Treatment of anaemia

Refer to the management of anemia (Haematology) section

3.0 IODINE DEFICIENCY DISORDERS (IDD)

Iodine is an essential component of the thyroid hormones ­ Triiodothyronine (T3) and
Tetraiodothyrinine (T4 or Thyroxine). The hormones have profound influence on energy
metabolism, protein synthesis, growth and development. They also play part in the conversion
of carotene to Vitamin A and synthesis of cholesterol. Insufficient level of iodine leads to
inadequate production of the hormones. This, in turn, affects brain development, physical
growth and functioning of muscles, heart, liver and kidneys. Goitre is an enlarged thyroid gland
­ a result of thyroid over-activity as it strives to capture sufficient iodine from the blood.
Deficiency of iodine results in pathological conditions referred collectively as iodine deficiency
disorders (IDD).

Manifestation of iodine deficiency:
Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) include the following:

     Goitre: Enlarged thyroid gland from over-activity
     Hypothyroidism: Dry skin, weight gain, puffy face, frequent constipation and lethargy ­

         from under-active thyroid
     Hyperthyroidism: Exophthalmia, rapid pulse and weight loss ­ from over-active thyroid
     Cretinism: Child born to a mother who was iodine deficient during pregnancy. Has

         mental retardation, retarded growth and neurological problems (spasticity).

369 | P a g e
Dietary measures
The iodine content of the individual foods varies considerably according to the type of soil,
fertilizer, animal feed and processing methods used.

     Natural food sources of iodine include:
              o Drinking water (reflecting amount of I2 present in the soil)
              o Fish,
              o Sea weeds (Sea weeds are rich in iodine but are a rare component of the diet).
              o Iodized salt (table salt fortified with iodine compound) is the strategy for control
                   of iodine deficiency worldwide. Potassium iodate (KIO3) or potassium iodide (KI)
                   is added to edible salt. The recommended iodization level in Tanzania is 40 to 70
                   parts per million (ppm).

Drug treatment
     Injectable iodized oil: given as intra-muscular injection. The iodine is retained in the
         body tissues for a long period of time (three to five years), maintaining the thyroid
         hormones at normal levels
     Iodinated oil capsules: 400 mg iodine administered orally, repeated after one to two
         years
     Lugol's solution: 3 drop (21 mg) once a month, up to one year

4.0 VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY (VAD)

Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin. It plays important roles in the body, including role in vision,
maintenance of epithelial tissue, synthesis of mucous secretion, growth, reproduction and
immunity.

Causes of VAD include the following:

     Low consumption of vitamin A rich foods (yellow fruits, green and pigmented
         vegetables, red palm oil, foods of animal origin)

     Dietary deficiency due to poor food processing, preservation and preparation.
     Limited consumption of fats and oils (for example, non-use of cooking oil) leading to

         poor absorption of vitamin A from food.
     Poor breastfeeding (non-use of colostrum, insufficient breastfeeding).
     Diseases that deplete vitamin A from the body (measles, ARI).
     Diseases affecting food absorption (chronic diarrhea, intestinal parasites).

Manifestation of VAD

     Xerophthalmia (the eye manifestations of VAD)
              o Night blindness
              o Xerosis (corneal, conjunctival)

370 | P a g e
              o Bitot's spots.
              o Corneal ulcer
              o Xerophthalmic fundus.
              o Keratomalacia (often leading to blindness).
     Slowed growth and development
     Reduced reproductive health
     Increased risk of anaemia
     Follicular hyperkeratosis.

Prevention of VAD

     Increase consumption of horticultural foods (fruits, vegetables)
     Consumption of red palm oil
     Improve child feeding practices (breastfeeding, complementary feeding)
     Use of cooking oil
     Early and proper treatment of diseases (measles, ARI, diarrhea, worms).
     Vitamin A supplementation (see National Guidelines for Micronutrient Supplementation)
     Use of food fortified with vitamin A.

Treatment of VAD (disease targeted supplementation)
Different treatment regimens are prescribed for patients presenting with different conditions, as
follows:

     Children presenting with xerophthalmia, measles or persistent diarrhea or severe acute
         malnutrition.

     Children presenting with moderate acute malnutrition, acute diarrhea or lower
         respiratory tract infections.

     Pregnant women presenting with xerophthalmia
         (See National Guidelines for Micronutrients Supplementation)

5.0 DEFICIENCY OF VITAMIN B1 (THIAMINE)

Vitamin B1 is utilized in carbohydrate, fats and protein metabolism for production of energy. It,
contributes to body's supply of niacin (another B vitamin) by facilitating in the conversion of
tryptophan (an amino acid) to niacin. Promotes appetite and supports the functioning of the
central nervous system. Thus deficiency leads to shortage of energy and lesions in nervous
tissues. Deficiency is commonly caused by consumption of highly polished cereals or foods
containing thiaminase (anti-thiamine factor). Alcoholics are also prone to deficiency of thiamine.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Characterized by enlargement of nerves, weight loss (due to loss of appetite), oedema
         and disturbance in heart function
     Lack of energy
     Lesions in nervous tissues.

371 | P a g e
Dietary measures
     Whole grain cereals and pulses
     Green vegetables (such as green peas)
     Fruits
     Fish, meat, milk, oil seed, yeast

Drug treatment
     Mild chronic thiamine deficiency & for those with malabsoption:
                   C: Vitamin B1 5 ­ 25 mg i/m every 12 hours for 3 days then orally for 1 month

     For severe deficiency:
                   C: Vitamin B1 200 ­ 300 mg daily for 3 days

6.0 VITAMIN B2 (RIBOFLAVIN) DEFICIENCY

Vitamin B2 is utilized in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins for production of
energy. Also it plays part in synthesis of corticosteroids and production of red blood cells.
Deficiency occurs in populations consuming highly polished cereals.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     It characterized by sore throat, pharyngeal and oral mucous membrane hyperaemia,
         angular stomatitis, cheilosis, glossitis and anemia
     Riboflavin deficiency almost invariably occurs in combination with other vitamin
         deficiencies.

Dietary measures
     Animal products (milk, meat liver, fish, eggs, cheese)
     Vegetable products (green leafy vegetables)
     Cereal grains and pulses

Drug treatment
                   C: Vitamin B-complex 1 tablet 8 hourly for 1 month.

7.0 VITAMIN B3 (NIACIN) DEFICIENCY

Niacin is utilized in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism for production of energy. In
Tanzania deficiency occurs in communities whose main staple food is maize or sorghum and
particularly during rainy season when food diversification is at its lowest. Deficiency leads to
Pellagra.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
It is a disease characterized by a triad, referred to as three Ds:

    o Dermatitis (darkened scaly skin on the parts exposed to the sun)
    o Diarrhea
    o Dementia (memory loss)
     Some patients may present also with glossitis

372 | P a g e
Dietary measures
     Animal products (especially liver), pork, poultry
     Groundnuts, beans, peas, other pulses, yeast
     Cereal grains (but not maize or sorghum)

Note
     Treatment of maize with alkalis such as limewater makes the niacin much more available
     Protein is good source as the amino acid tryptophan can be converted to niacin in the
         gut.

Drug treatment
                   C: Nicotinamide: Adult gives 100 mg every 6 hours for 7 days followed by
                   multivitamin preparation containing 50 to 60 mg of nicotinamide daily for 1
                   month.
                     Children: 10 to 25 mg every 8 hours for 7 days, followed by multivitamin
                   preparation as above.

8.0 VITAMIN B6 (PYRIDOXINE) DEFICIENCY

Pyridoxine is involved in synthesis and breakdown of amino acids (hence important in protein
metabolism), in the conversion of glycogen in the liver and muscle tissue to glucose (hence
maintenance of blood glucose levels), and in reaction that produces a heme precursor,
necessary for formation of haemoglobin. Pyridoxine also aids in the conversion of amino acid
tryptophan to niacin. Disease or clinical features associated specifically with pyridoxine are rare.
However, various medical conditions and drugs affect vitamin pyridoxine metabolism, for
example, deficiency of the vitamin occurs in patients who are on chloramphenicol and TB
patients who are on isoniazid

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Dermatitis, glossitis, cheilosis
     Macrocytic anaemia
     Convulsions

Dietary measures
     Animal sources ­ meat, liver, pork, fish, milk.
     Vegetables ­ spinach, turnips, broccoli
     Fruits ­ bananas, oranges, water melon
     Yeast

Drug treatment
                   C: Pyridoxine 50 mg every 8 hours until recovery

     In case deficiency is isoniazid induced, it should be replaced with ethambutol.

373 | P a g e
9.0 VITAMIN B12 (COBALAMIN) DEFICIENCY

Vitamin B12 is involved in the synthesis of the thymine nucleotides of DNA (along with folic acid)
and therefore in the synthesis of red blood cells. It plays part in the metabolism of fatty acids,
hence in the formation of myelin (the sheathing around the axons of nerve cells). The vitamin is
involved also in the carbohydrate metabolism (stabilizes glutathione ­ a component of enzymes
needed in carbohydrate metabolism).

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Macrocytic megaloblastic anaemia
     Decreased white blood cells
     Angular stomatitis, glossitis
     Delusions, nerve problems, unsteady gait.

Dietary measures
Main source is animal foods ­ meat, liver, seafood, eggs, milk, and cheese.
Note

          Animals or plants do not synthesize the vitamin ­ it is synthesized by bacteria in
              animals.

          Humans can not obtain the vitamin by action of bacteria in the gut because it can
              not be absorbed very far down the intestine

          Some plants (legumes that contain nodule bacteria) can synthesize the vitamin

Drug treatment
Adult

                   C: Cyanocobalamin 50 to 150µg (O) daily, taken between meals.

                   Children up to one year: 0.5 mg/kg body weight daily

11.0 VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID) DEFICIENCY

Vitamin C helps the body use calcium and other nutrients to build boned and the walls of blood
vessels, helps form collagen which is important for connective tissues, increases absorption of
iron from foods, increases resistance to infection, enhances protein metabolism, is an
antioxidant.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Scurvy (bleeding gums, dry skin, dry mouth, impaired wound healing).
     Gingivitis (bleeding sore and inflamed gums)
     Stomatitis (sores on corners of the mouth)
     Anaemia (of iron deficiency)

     In malabsoption patients injectables Ascorbic acid IV/IM 500mg

12.0 VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY

Vitamin D facilitates calcium and phosphorus absorption and utilization, hence formation of
bones and teeth.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Rickets ­ a disease of bones in infants and children
     Osteomalacia in adults

375 | P a g e
Prevention
     Exposure of the skin to sunshine (vitamin D is produced by the action of the sun on the
         skin)
     Vitamin D rich foods: wheat germ, fish, liver, egg yolk, organ meats, cheese, milk
         (breast milk other milks), butter, margarine, mayonnaise.

Drug treatment

                   months

13.0 VITAMIN E (TOCOPHEROL) DEFICIENCY

Vitamin E is an antioxidant. It plays role in reproductive health (enhances fertility) and also in
haemoglobin synthesis.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency

     Leg cramps,
     Muscle weakness,
     Nerve problems and
     Hearing problems.

Dietary measures
     Consumption of vegetable oils
     Whole grain cereals

Drug treatment

Adult

               C: Alpha tocopherol acetate 50 - 100mg daily until recovery
               Below 1 yr: 50mg until recovery

14.0 VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY

Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of prothrombin in the liver, factor VII, IX and X. It also
helps in the production of proteins necessary for bone calcification. Primary deficiency of
vitamin K occurs only in neonates. Secondary deficiency may be associated with malabsorption
syndrome, liver cirrhosis and the use of Coumarin derivatives such as dicumarol, warfarin and
other analogues.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Injuries/wounds taking long to stop bleeding.
     Infants are relatively deficient in vitamin K and therefore at risk of serious bleeds
         including intracranial bleeding.

376 | P a g e
Dietary measures
Vitamin K exists in two forms (K1 and K2) and is obtained in foods of plant and animal origins:

     Vitamin K1 (phylloquinone), synthesised by plants
     Vitamin K2 (menaquinone), synthesized by bacteria in animal intestine

Drug treatment
     Adults:
                   D: Phytomenadione 10 mg i/v stat
     To prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding (haemorrhagic disease of the newborn):
                   D: Phytomenadione 0.5-1 mg i/m once, at birth
                                       OR
                   D: Phytomenadione 2 mg, two doses given in the first week. Third dose given at
                   1 month.

Not use in patients with suspected Warfarin overdose and neonates

15.0 ZINC DEFICIENCY

Zinc is known to be essential nutrient for the body. It is a component of insulin and many
enzymes, including:

     Carbonic anhydrase (which transports CO2 from RBCs to the lungs).
     Carboxypeptidase (necessary for peptide digestion)
     Alcohol dehydrogenase
It plays role in the synthesis of nucleic acids and protein, metabolism of vitamin A from the liver
and wound healing (synthesis of collagen) and enhancement of absorption of folic acid

Zinc occurs in all tissues, higher concentrations being in:

     The choroid membrane of the eye.
     Male reproductive organs (especially the prostate gland).
     In the red blood cells.
     In the pancreas (as component of insulin).
     Relatively lower concentrations in the liver, skeletal muscle, bone, skin and hair.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Slow growth
     Loss of smell and taste
     Loss of appetite
     Diarrhoea
     Poor wound healing
     Skin lesions

Dietary measures
Zinc is present in most foods of animal and plant origins.

     The richest sources tend to be protein rich foods e.g. meat, seafood, eggs yolk and
         oysters.

377 | P a g e
 Cereal grains and legumes also contain zinc (but milling reduces the zinc content. Also
    phytates found in whole grain products and vegetables reduces the bioavailability of
    zinc.

 Fruits, vegetables and egg white are poor sources of zinc.

Treatment

           A: Zinc tablets 50mg 2 to 3 times daily until recovery

Zinc supplementation- Refer to National Guideline Micronutrient supplementation

16.0 SELENIUM DEFICIENCY

Selenium functions as a component of glutathione peroxidase ­ a powerful antioxidant.
Kwashiorkor children have shown improved weight gain with selenium supplementation. In
China selenium deficiency has led to "Kesharis disease" ­ a serious condition affecting heart
muscle.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Muscle weakness
     Pancreatitis (blockage of the pancreatic ducts
     Impaired growth
     Impaired hearing
     Impaired immune system
     Faster HIV infection progression and reduced survival

Dietary sources
     Selenium is found in most body tissues, highest concentrations being in the kidney, liver,
         spleen, pancreas and testes
     Selenium content of food varies with their protein content. Meats, seafoods, egg yolk
         and milk are good sources of selenium
     In cereals, selenium content depends on the concentration of the mineral in the soil
     Mushrooms and asparagus are rich sources. But boiling these vegetables causes the
         mineral to be leached

Drug treatment

                   A: Selenium IM/IV / oral 100 -500 microgram daily until recovery

17.0 CALCIUM DEFICIENCY

Calcium strengthens bones and teeth, facilitates normal functioning of the heart and helps
blood clotting. Calcium also helps in the maintenance of normal blood pressure.

378 | P a g e
Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Delayed blood clotting
     Osteoporosis (weak breakable bones)
     Osteomalacia
     Teeth problems
     Low resistance to infection
     Stunting

Dietary measures
     Foods of animal origin: milk, yoghurt, cheese
     Fish with bones that are eaten (dagaa)
     Vegetables: green leafy vegetables such as broccoli
     Legumes, peas.

Drug treatment:
Adults

                   D: Calcium gluconate 10% I.V (94.7 mg elemental calcium) at a rate of not
                   exceeding 5ml/minute. 10ml
                   Pediatric dose: Calcium gluconate 10% I.V (47.5 mg elemental calcium) at a
                   rate of not exceeding 5ml/minute

                                       OR
                   C: Calcium gluconate 500mg daily until recovery

18.0 COPPER DEFICIENCY

All body tissues contain some copper. But highest concentrations are in the liver, brain, heart,
kidneys and in the blood. Copper in the form of ceruloplesmin (a copper-protein complex in the
blood plasma) is involved in various stages of iron nutrition. Copper enhances iron absorption
and stimulates mobilization of iron from stores (in the liver and other tissues). Plays part in the
conversion of ferrous iron to ferric (important during various stages of iron metabolism).
Copper-containing enzymes play part in carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. Copper
deficiency has been linked to anaemia in premature infants and in people with severe protein-
energy malnutrition. Menke's disease (a rare congenital condition) is caused by failure of copper
absorption.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Mental deterioration
     Hypothermia
     Hair depigmentation
     Microcytic anaemia (indistinguishable from iron deficiency anaemia) affecting infants and
         people with severe PEM.

Dietary measures
     Foods richest in copper are nuts, shellfish, liver, kidney, raisins and legumes. Milk is a
         poor source of copper.
     Milling, grinding and cooking in water tend to reduce copper content.

379 | P a g e
     Copper content of foods is also influenced by environmental factors such as:
         o Copper content in the soil
         o Geographical location, for example, close to a copper industry.
         o Kind of fertilizer used.
         o Water equipment made of copper.

19.0 MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCY

In the body magnesium is found in the bone, muscle, in the soft tissues and in blood. Many of
the physiological functions of Mg are based on the mineral's ability to interact with calcium,
phosphate and carbonate salts. Magnesium catalyses many essential enzymatic reactions
(glucose, fatty acid, amino acid metabolism), takes part in bone metabolism and protein
synthesis. Mg is important in nervous activity and muscle contraction. NB: Under certain
circumstances (e.g. diarrhea and severe PEM etc.) excessive body losses of Mg may occur. This
leads to weakness and mental changes and, occasionally, to convulsions.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency
     Muscle spasms, cramps
     Tremors, seizures, coma

Dietary measures
     Most foods contain adequate amounts of magnesium
     Animal foods: good source is dairy products, meats and poultry
     Vegetables: green vegetables (okra, broccoli), cucumber skin
     Fruits: especially avocado
     Cereals (whole grain)
     Legumes
     Seafood

Drug treatment
                   D: Magnesium sulphate 0.5 to 1 mmol/kg I.V/I.M up to 160 mmol per day for 5
                   days.
                   Maintenance: oral dose 24 mmol per day in divided doses

21.0 FLUORINE DEFICIENCY

Fluorine is a mineral that plays a protective role to bone and dental tissues: It protects against
dental caries (makes them resistant to weak organic acids formed from foods that get stuck
between teeth). It prevents bones from developing osteoporosis. Fluorine enhances iron
absorption (protects against anaemia) and enhances wound healing.

NB: High concentration of fluorides in water (above 6 ppm) causes mottling of teeth (dark
brown stain). Chronic ingestion of high concentrations (from natural high content in the area or
environmental pollution) can lead to bone and tooth malformations.

Signs and symptoms of deficiency

     Dental caries.
     (Mottling of teeth and skeletal malformations are a result of excessive fluoride).

380 | P a g e
Dietary measures
Most animal and plant foods contain amounts that reflect the content in the soil.

     Fish and seaweed are rich sources.
     Other rich sources include bone meal, meats and dairy products
     Grains, vegetables and nuts.
Drug treatment:
In areas where drinking water is fluoridated and the floride content is above 0.7 parts per
million. Supplemetation is not recommended.

                   S: Fluorine tabs: Under 6 yrs 250 micrograms daily
                     Over 6 years : 500 micrograms to 1mg daily

22.0 MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES

Micronutrient deficiencies are a major health problem in Tanzania. Deficiencies occur across all
population groups but women and children are highly vulnerable because of rapid growth and
inadequate dietary practices. These include deficiencies of vitamin A, iron, iodine and zinc.
Interventions to address micronutrient deficiencies include food based approaches whereby
production and consumption of micronutrients rich foods are promoted. Micronutrient
supplementation programs target most vulnerable groups such as pregnant and lactating
women, and children aged below 5 years.
Food fortification with micronutrients is another approach aimed to deliver micronutrients to the
general population, most vulnerable groups included. Food fortification includes iodization of
edible salt and fortification of staple foods such as cereal flours and cooking oil. Other
interventions target children aged 6 to 23 months with a single dose of packets containing
multiple vitamins and minerals in powder form that can be sprinkled onto any semi solid
complementary food at the point of use.

Dietary measures
Promote production and consumption of fortified foods

381 | P a g e
Intervention:
Food fortification has been defined as the addition of one or more essential nutrients to a food,
whether or not it is normally contained in the food, for the purpose of preventing or correcting
a demonstrated deficiency of one or more nutrients in the population or specific population
groups (FAO/WHO 1994). Below are requirement for food fortification in Tanzania.

                                   POISONING

1.0 Common poisonings

These can be intentional or accidental. Suspect poisoning in any unexplained illness in a
previously healthy child/adult. Traditional medicines can also be a source of poisoning.

Diagnosis
This is made from relevant history elicited from patient, relatives or friends, from clinical
examination, and the results of investigations, where appropriate.

 Find out full details of the poisoning agent, the amount ingested and the time of
    ingestion. Attempt to identify the exact agent involved requesting to see the container,
    where relevant.

 Check for signs of burns in or around the mouth or of stridor (laryngeal damage)
    suggesting ingestion of corrosives:

    o Admit all patients who have ingested iron, pesticides, paracetamol or aspirin, narcotics,
         antidepressant medicines;

    o Patients who have ingested corrosives or petroleum products should not be sent home
         without observation for 6 hours. Corrosives can cause oesophageal burns which may not
         be immediately apparent and petroleum products, if aspirated, can cause pulmonary
         oedema which may take some hours to develop.

General Principles of Management

     Observe person and patient safety
     Remove patient from source of poison
     Support vital function

              o Establish and maintain a clear airway
              o Ensure adequate ventilation and oxygenation
              o Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, pupil size and

                   responsiveness

2. 0 Principles for management of ingested poisons

     Gastric decontamination is most effective within one hour of ingestion.

     Gastric decontamination will not guarantee that all of the substance has been removed.

         Contraindications to gastric lavage are:

              o An unprotected airway in an unconscious patient
              o Ingestion of corrosives or petroleum products e.g. kerosene

384 | P a g e
     Check the patient for emergency signs: coma, convulsions, acute confusion, hepatic
         and/or renal failure, skin eruption, psychiatric or neurologic disturbance of acute onset
         and check for hypoglycaemia.

     Identify the specific agent and remove or adsorb it as soon as possible.

    Note: Treatment is most effective if given as quickly as possible after the poisoning event,
    ideally within 1 hour.

     If the the patient has swallowed kerosene, petrol or petrol-based products (note that
         most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents) or if the patient's mouth and throat have
         been burned (for example with bleach, toilet cleaner or battery acid) do not vomit the
         patient but give water orally.

    Treatment
     Never use salt as an emetic as this can be fatal.
     Give activated charcoal, if available, and do not induce vomiting; give by mouth or NG

         tube according to table below.

Amount of activated charcoal per dose
    o Children up to one year of age: 1 g/kg
    o Children 1 to 12 years of age: 25 to 50 g

Adolescents and adults: 25 to 100 g

    o Mix the charcoal in 8­10 times the amount of water, e.g. 5 g in 40 ml of water.

    o If possible, give the whole amount at once; if the child has difficulty in tolerating it, the
         charcoal dose can be divided.

    o If charcoal is not available, then induce vomiting but only if the patient is conscious by
         rubbing the back of the patient throat with a spatula or spoon handle; if this does not
         work, give an emetic such as ipecacuanha (10 ml for 6 months to 2 year-olds or 15 ml
         for over 2 years); if this does not work, then try rubbing the back of the patient's throat
         again.

    Note: Ipecacuanha can cause repeated vomiting, drowsiness and lethargy which can
    confuse the diagnosis of poisoning.

Gastric lavage
     Only do it in health care facilities if staff has experience in the procedure, and if the
         ingestion was only a few hours ago and is life threatening, and there has been no
         ingestion of corrosives or petroleum derivatives
     Make sure a suction apparatus is available in case the patient vomits
     Place the patient in the left lateral/ head down position
     Insert a large NGT. Ensure the tube is in the stomach
     Perform lavage with 10 ml/kg body weight of warm normal saline (0.9%). The volume
         of lavage fluid returned should approximate to the amount of fluid given.

385 | P a g e
     Lavage should be continued until the recovered lavage solution is clear of particulate
         matter. Note that tracheal intubation may be required to reduce risk of aspiration.

    o Give specific antidote if this is indicated
    o Give general care.
    o Keep the patient under observation for 4­24 hours depending on the poison swallowed
Referal
Consider transferring patient to next level referral hospital, where appropriate and where this
can be done safely, if the patient is unconscious or has deteriorating conscious level, has burns
to mouth and throat, is in severe respiratory distress, is cyanosed or is in heart failure.

3.0 PRINCIPLES FOR MANAGEMENT OF POISONS IN CONTACT WITH
SKIN OR EYES

Skin contamination

     Remove all clothing and personal effects and thoroughly flush all exposed areas with
         copious amounts of tepid water.

     Use soap and water for oily substances.

     Attending staff should take care to protect themselves from secondary contamination by
         wearing gloves and apron.

     Removed clothing and personal effects should be stored safely in a see-through plastic
         bag that can be sealed, for later cleansing or disposal.

Eye contamination

     Rinse the eye for 10­15 minutes with clean running water or saline, taking care that the
         run-off does not enter the other eye.

     The use of anaesthetic eye drops will assist irrigation.

     Evert the eyelids and ensure that all surfaces are rinsed.

     In the case of an acid or alkali irrigate for 15­20 minutes

     Where possible, the eye should be thoroughly examined under fluorescein staining for
         signs of corneal damage. If there is significant conjunctival or corneal damage, the
         patient should be seen urgently by an ophthalmologist.

4.0 PRINCIPLES FOR MANAGEMENT OF INHALED POISONS

     Remove from the source of exposure.

     Administer supplemental oxygen if required.

Inhalation of irritant gases may cause swelling and upper airway obstruction, bronchospasm
and delayed pneumonitis. Intubation, bronchodilators and ventilatory support may be required.

386 | P a g e
5.0 SPECIFIC POISONS

5.1 Management for corrosive compounds poisoning

Examples--sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, acids, bleaches or disinfectants

     Do not induce vomiting or use activated charcoal
     Give milk or water as soon as possible.
     Then give the patient nothing by mouth and arrange for surgical review to check for

         oesophageal damage/rupture, if severe.

5.2 Management for petroleum compounds poisoning

Examples--kerosene, turpentine substitutes and petrol

     Do not induce vomiting as inhalation can cause respiratory distress with hypoxaemia due
         to pulmonary oedema and lipoid pneumonia. Ingestion can cause encephalopathy.
         Supportive treatment includes oxygen therapy if respiratory distress present

5.3 Management for Organo-phosphorus and carbamate
compounds poisoning

Examples: organophosphorus ­ Malathion, Parathion, TEPP, mevinphos and carbamates ­
methiocarb and carbaryl.

These can be absorbed through the skin, ingested or inhaled. The patient may complain of
vomiting, diarrhoea, blurred vision or weakness. Signs are those of excess parasympathetic
activation: salivation, sweating, lacrimation, slow pulse, small pupils, convulsions, muscle
weakness/twitching, then paralysis and loss of bladder control, pulmonary oedema, and
respiratory depression.

Treatment

     Remove poison by irrigating eye or washing skin (if in eye or on skin).

     Give activated charcoal if ingested and within 1 hour of the ingestion.

     Do not induce vomiting because most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents.

     In a serious ingestion where activated charcoal cannot be given, consider careful
         aspiration of stomach contents by NG tube (the airway should be protected).

     If the has signs of excess parasympathetic activation (see above) give

                             B: Atropine 15­50 micrograms/kg IM or IV over 15 minutes. Repeat
                             every 10- 15 minutes until no chest signs of secretions, and pulse and
                             respiratory rate returns to normal.

387 | P a g e
         Auscultate the chest for signs of respiratory secretions and monitor respiratory rate,
         heart rate and coma score (if appropriate).

     Consider obidoxime (a cholinestarase activator) 3-5mg/kg IV if <24 hours. It may be
         given 5minutes after the first dose of atropine.

     Check for hypoxaemia with pulse oximetry. Give oxygen if oxygen saturation is less that
         90%.

     If muscle weakness give

                   S: Pralidoxime (cholinesterase reactivator) 25­50mg/kg diluted with 15 ml water
                   for injection by IV infusion over 30 minutes repeated once to twice, followed by
                   10 to 20 mg/kg/hour, as necessary.

5.4 Management of Paracetamol poisoning

     If within 1 hour of ingestion of 150mg/kg or more paracetamol give activated charcoal,
         if available, or induce vomiting.

         For conscious and no vomiting give

                   C: Methionine (<6 years: 1 gram every 4 hours - 4 doses; 6 years and above:
                   2.5 grams every 4 hours for 4 doses).

     If more than 8 hours after ingestion, or the patient cannot take oral treatment, give

                   C: Acetylcysteine 150mg/kg IV in 200mls 5% dextrose over 20 minutes, then
                   50mg/kg in 500mls 5% dextrose over 4 hours, then 100mg/kg in 1 liter of 5%
                   dextrose over 16 hours.

                   In severe poisoning a further 100mg/kg may be given over the next 24 hours

          For children <20 kg give the loading dose of 150 mg/kg in 3 ml/kg of 5% glucose over
         15 minutes, followed by 50 mg/kg in 7 ml/kg of 5% glucose over 4 hours, then 100
         mg/kg IV in 14 ml/kg of 5% glucose over 16 hours.

         Monitor electrolyte especially potassium.

5.5 Management of Aspirin and other salicylates poisoning

The patient can rapidly become acidotic and are consequently more likely to suffer the severe
CNS effects of toxicity.

Salicylate overdose can be complex to manage. These cause acidotic-like breathing, vomiting
and tinnitus.

 Give activated charcoal within one hour of ingestion if available. If charcoal is not available
    and a severely toxic dose has been given, then perform gastric lavage or induce vomiting as
    above

 If available check the blood gases, pH, bicarbonates and serum electrolyte.

388 | P a g e
 Replace fluid losses (Plasma potassium concentration should be corrected before giving
    sodium bicarbonate as hypokalaemia may complicate alkalinisation of urine)

 Give IV sodium bicarbonate 1 mmol/kg over 4 hours to correct acidosis and to raise the pH
    of the urine to above 7.5 so that salicylate excretion is increased. Monitor urine pH hourly.

 Give IV fluids at maintenance requirements

 Haemodialysis is required if the concentration exceeds 700mg/litre or in presence of severe
    metabolic acidosis

 Monitor blood glucose every 6 hours and correct as necessary

5.6 Management of Iron poisoning

 Check for clinical features of iron poisoning: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and
    diarrhoea. The vomitus and stools are often grey or black. In severe poisoning there may be
    gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hypotension, drowsiness, convulsions and metabolic acidosis.

 Gastrointestinal features usually appear in the first 6 hours and a patient who has remained
    asymptomatic for this time probably does not require antidote treatment.

 Activated charcoal does not bind to iron salts; therefore consider giving a gastric lavage if
    potentially toxic amounts of iron were taken.

 Give antidote treatment

                   D: Deferoxamine 50 mg/kg IM up to a maximum of 1 g by deep IM injection
                   repeated every 12 hours; if very ill, give IV infusion 15 mg/kg/hour to a
                   maximum of 80 mg/kg in 24 hours.

5.7 Management of Carbon monoxide poisoning

 Give 100% oxygen to accelerate removal of carbon monoxide (note patient can look pink
    but still be hypoxaemic) until signs of hypoxia disappear.

 Check blood gases and serum electrolyte

Prevention of Poisoning

 Keep medicines and poisons in proper containers and out of reach of children
 Advise patients/care takers on first aid if this happens again in the future
 Do not make the patient vomit if they have swallowed kerosene, petrol or petrol based

    products or if patient's mouth and throat have been burned, nor if the patient is drowsy.

 Try to make the patient vomit if other medicines or poisons have been taken by stimulating
    the back of the throat.

 Take the patient to a health facility as soon as possible, together with information about the
    substance concerned such as container, label, sample of tablets, berries etc.

6.0 BITES

6.1 Management of Insects Bites
Important insect bites are those from scorpions.

Symptoms: Most bites and stings result in pain, swelling, redness, and itching to the affected
area.

Treatment and Management
Treatment depends on the type of reaction

     Clean the area with soap and water to remove contaminated particles left behind by
         some insects

     Refrain from scratching because this may cause the skin to break down and results to an
         infection

     Treat itching at the site of the bite with antihistamine
     Give appropriate analgesics
     Where there is an anaphylactic reaction treat according to guideline.

6.2 Management of Scorpion sting

Scorpion stings can be very painful for days. Systemic effects of venom are much more
common in children than adults.

Diagnosis of Scorpion poisoning (envenoming)
Signs of envenoming can develop within minutes and are due to autonomic nervous system
activation. They include:

    o Shock
    o High or low BP
    o Fast and/or irregular pulse
    o Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
    o Breathing difficulty (due to heart failure) or respiratory failure
    o Muscle twitches and spasms.
    o Check for low BP or raised BP and treat if signs of heart failure

Treatment
First aid

    o Transport to hospital as soon as possible.
Hospital care

Antivenom
    o If signs of severe envenoming give scorpion antivenom, if available (as above for snake
         antivenom infusion).

Other treatment
    o Treat heart failure, if present

Supportive care
    o Give oral paracetamol or oral or IM Morphine according to severity. If very severe,
         infiltrate site with 1% lignocaine, without epinephrine.

390 | P a g e
6.3 Management of Snake bite/Poisoning

Less than 10% of 3500 snake species are poisonous and they include cobras and mambas
(Elapidac), see snakes (hydrophidac) and the boomslang and vine snakes (columbidac). It is a
common problem in Tanzania. Clinical condition depends on the type of snake bite and amount
of poison (venom) injected. Hence envenomation (poisoning) will be neurotoxic in cobra and
mambas and sea snakes and haemotoxic in vipers and boomslang.

Snake bite should be considered in any severe pain or swelling of a limb or in any unexplained
illness presenting with bleeding or abnormal neurological signs. Some cobras spit venom into
the eyes of victims causing pain and inflammation. Contact with snakes, scorpions and other
insects result in two types of injuries: those due to direct effect of venom on victim and those
due to indirect effect of poison e.g. hypersensitivity reaction to bee sting.

Diagnosis of snake poisoning (envenoming)
 General signs include shock, vomiting and headache. Examine bite for local necrosis,

    bleeding or tender local lymph node enlargement.
 Specific signs depend on the venom and its effects. These include:

           o Shock
           o Local swelling that may gradually extend up the bitten limb
           o Bleeding: external from gums, wounds or sores; internal especially intracranial
           o Signs of neurotoxicity: respiratory arrest or paralysis, ptosis, bulbar palsy (difficulty

                swallowing and talking), limb weakness
           o Signs of muscle breakdown: muscle pains and black urine
 Check haemoglobin (where possible, blood clotting should be assessed).

Treatment
First aid
 Reasure the patient;
 Splint the limb to reduce movement and absorption of venom. If the bite was likely to have

    come from a snake with neurotoxic venom, apply a firm bandage to the affected limb from
    fingers or toes to proximal of site of bite;
 Clean the site with clean water to remove any poison and remove any fangs;
 If any of the above signs, transport to hospital which has antivenom as soon as possible. If
    snake has already been killed, take this with patient to hospital to hospital.

Treatment
Hospital care
Treatment of shock/respiratory arrest
 Treat shock, if present.

 Paralysis of respiratory muscles can last for days and requires intubation and mechanical
    ventilation or manual ventilation (with a mask or endotracheal tube and bag) by relays of
    staff and/or relatives until respiratory function returns. Attention to careful securing of
    endotracheal tube is important. An alternative is to perform an elective tracheostomy.

Antivenom

391 | P a g e
 If there are systemic signs or severe local signs (swelling of more than half of the limb or
    severe necrosis), give antivenom, if available

 Prepare IM Epinephrine and IV Chlorpheniramine and be ready if allergic reaction occurs.

 Give monovalent antivenom if the species of snake is known.

 Give polyvalent antivenom if the species is not known. Follow the directions given on the
    antivenom preparation.

 Dilute the antivenom in 2­3 volumes of 0.9% saline and give intravenously over 1 hour.

 Give more slowly initially and monitor closely for anaphylaxis or other serious adverse
    reactions.

 If itching/urticarial rash, restlessness, fever, cough or difficult breathing develop, then stop
    antivenom and give Epinephrine 0.01 ml/kg of 1/1000 or 0.1 ml/kg of 1/10,000 solution
    subcutaneously and IM or IV/SC Chlorpheniramine 250 micrograms/kg. When the patient is
    stable, re-start antivenom infusion slowly.

 More antivenom should be given after 6 hours if there is recurrence of blood incoagulability
    or after 1­2 hr if the patient is continuing to bleed briskly or has deteriorating neurotoxic or
    cardiovascular signs.

 Blood transfusion should not be required if antivenom is given.

 Response of abnormal neurological signs to antivenom is more variable and depends on
    type of venom.

 If there is no reponse to antivenom infusion this should be repeated.

 Anticholinesterases can reverse neurological signs in some species of snake (see standard
    textbooks of medicine for further details).

Other treatment

 Surgical opinion

Seek surgical opinion if there is severe swelling in a limb, it is pulseless or painful or there is
local necrosis. Surgical care will include:

    o Excision of dead tissue from wound

    o Incision of fascial membranes to relieve pressure in limb compartments, if necessary

    o Skin grafting, if extensive necrosis

    o Tracheostomy (or endotracheal intubation) if paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing
         occurs

Supportive care

392 | P a g e
 Give fluids orally or by NG tube according to daily requirements.Keep a close record of fluid
    intake and output.

 Provide adequate pain relief
 Elevate limb if swollen
 Give antitetanus prophylaxis
 Antibiotic treatment is not required unless there is tissue necrosis at wound site
Monitor very closely immediately after admission, then hourly for at least 24 hours as
envenoming can develop rapidly.

8.0 MANAGEMENT OF OTHER SOURCES OF POISONING (ENVENOMING)

   The same principles of treatment, as above. Give antivenom, where available, if severe
       local or any systemic effects.

   In general, venomous spider bites can be painful but rarely result in systemic envenoming.
   Antivenom is available for some species such as widow and banana spiders. Venomous

       fish can give very severe local pain but systemic envenoming is rare.
   Box jellyfish stings are occasionally rapidly lifethreatening. Apply vinegar on cotton wool to

       denature the protein in the skin.
   Adherent tentacles should be carefully removed. Rubbing the sting may cause further

       discharge of venom.
   The dose of antivenom to jellyfish and spiders should be determined by the amount of the

       venom injected.
   Higher doses are required for multiple bites, severe symptoms or delayed presentation.
