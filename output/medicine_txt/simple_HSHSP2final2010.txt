                                               FOREWORD

During the past twenty five years, Tanzania has seen the evolution of the HIV and AIDS epidemic from a rare and
unknown disease to a familiar condition that today is known to most households. In 1983, the initial AIDS cases
were reported in the Kagera region in North Western Tanzania. In 1986, three years later, all regions of Tanzania
Mainland had reported AIDS patients. By 2004, about 7 per cent of the Tanzanian population aged 15 and 49 years
were estimated to be infected with Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In response to this epidemic, a number of actions have been implemented by the Government and other stakeholders
aiming to roll back the epidemic and mitigate its impacts. These actions which constitute the national response to
HIV/AIDS,    have  grown over time   from the initial health sector response  between 1985 and  2000     to a  broad
stakeholder response that has received a special multisectoral emphasis in recent years following the formation of
the Tanzania Commission for AIDS in the year 2000.

Despite these efforts, availability of core HIV and AIDS interventions is far from becoming universally accessible
to all. Most interventions for HIV and AIDS prevention, care and support      are delivered through the health care
system and their coverage is yet to reach most primary health care facilities. Further more, the fact that most
interventions are delivered in health facilities, their uptake by certain population groups which are most vulnerable
to HIV and which play a major role in the spread of the epidemic, is limited. These groups include among others,
men who have sex with men, commercial sex workers, injection drug users as well as women and youth in general.
During the past twenty fives years of the national response, the health sector has played a very critical role in
creating public awareness on HIV and AIDS as well as providing most services for prevention, care, treatment and
support.  In order to strengthen the already  established interventions as well make  further expansion     of these
services, which are part of the national multisectoral response to HIV and AIDS, the health sector has developed a
Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategy which will provide guidance to the operations of the sectoral response in the
next five years. This strategy which is a successor to the previous strategy of 2003-2006 will be known as Health
Sector HIV and AIDS Strategy II. 2008-2012(HSHSP-II) .The HSHSP-II shall strife to add a new critical phase to
the national multisectoral efforts against HIV and AIDS. In this phase, the core health sector based HIV and AIDS
interventions will be made universally accessible to all Tanzanians in need. Furthermore, during the lifetime of
HSSHSP-II, the core services will be brought closer to the communities and made friendlier to the beneficiaries.
The selection of interventions contained in the HSHSP II is based on the comparative advantages of the health
sector. In that connection, most services are those that are delivered through the health services delivery system. The
strategy will not scale up the availability of services but will also strengthen the capacity of the health system to
deliver quality services at national, regional, district and community levels. The envisioned strengthening will avoid
creating vertical HIV AND AIDS services by integrating all interventions in the routine health services.
Through the strengthened and scale up health sector response to HIV and AIDS, it is expected that new infections
will be prevented and those affected by HIV and AIDS will be accorded appropriate care, treatment and support
services.

I wish to call upon the health sector stakeholders to make use of this strategy as their guidance in making their
contribution to the national response to HIV and AIDS.

                                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction

This Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (HSHSP-2008-2012) is the contribution of the Health sector to the
overall National Multisectoral Strategic Framework (NMSF-2008-2012).           The theme of the HSHSP is "universal
access to preventive, care, treatment and support services"

The plan has been prepared at the time when the country and, in particular, the health sector, is facing significant
challenges such as serious human resource crisis, inadequate funds to immediately deal with the health problems
and geographical imbalances in the distribution of the available resources within the country.

Background

Health Sector Performance and Disease Burden
Over the past five years, the overall performance of the health sector has shown some improvements and there is
government commitment to allocate more resources. The country has recorded successes in key HIV and AIDS
interventions, such as: increased coverage for PMTCT, introduction and expanded care and treatment, increased
availability of condoms,  increased    counseling and  testing  services, expansion  of   services to communities  and
household levels. Lastly measures to monitor the epidemic are in place.

Despite these improvements, the biggest challenge is that the epidemic is far from being contained. Currently, the
majority of people in need of services cannot access them especially the vulnerable groups and rural areas. The
challenges of assuring quality of services being provided remains an area of great concern. Although resources are
being allocated to the epidemic by the government, sustainability still remains a formidable task.

In order to successfully implement this strategic plan, the following assumptions are made:
         Continued peace and political stability in the country;
         There will be adequate numbers of appropriately trained and well motivated health workers;
         Macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth will continue;
         Increased Government prioritisation and funding to the health sector;
         Increased Partners support to  other programmes within the health sector; and
         Timely and appropriate attention to implementation of all health priority areas.

Vision, Mission, Goals and Key Principles

 Vision:           "Tanzania united in its efforts to reduce the spread of HIV and to provide the best available care
                   for those infected and affected by the virus."
 Mission           Working in partnership with other public sectors, private sector, civil society and communities to
                   play a leading role   in the   prevention of  further  spread of HIV   AND  AIDS    and   mitigate its
                   impacts by providing essential interventions and quality care.
 Goals:                 To scale up the health sector response to HIV and AIDS and strengthen the health system
                        capacity to support HI and AIDS interventions,
                        To promote access and utilization of affordable and essential interventions and commodities
                        for HIV and AIDS, and
                        To improve the quality of HIV and AIDS interventions to the general public, PLHIV, health
                        care providers and other vulnerable populations.

National HIV and AIDS Priority Interventions
Though the lesson of prioritization in terms of focusing on few interventions has been acknowledged, this strategic
plan has included  some   illustrative activities to serve   as a menu    that accommodates   the  interests of various
stakeholders involved in the health sector response.

There are four themes including the health system strengthening. The health system interventions represent support
services which facilitate the efficient and effective management of the health sector HIV and AIDS response, and
without which implementation of the HIV and AIDS priorities would be seriously compromised.

                                                                                                                   vii

Financing the Health sector response for HIV and AIDS

The Health Sector Strategy for HIV and AIDS 2008-2012 is estimated to cost between US$2,078 million and
US$2,287 million.     The projected resources to be mobilized during the same period range from        US$1,470 million
to US$2,301 million.     Therefore, the plan will be operated under a deficit budget of between US$311 million and
US$320 million. The gaps in meeting the demands of HIV interventions in the next five years will increase with
time.

Implementation Framework

Implementation
The duration of the HSHSP is five years, from 1 July 2008 to 31 June 2013. The HSHSP is closely linked with the
NMSF   2008-12    and  the Medium     Term  Expenditure   Framework   (MTEF).   The HSHSP will be operationalised
through MTEF plans and annual action plans and budgets.

The HSHSP will be implemented and coordinated through the existing health sector organisational and management
structures  at national, regional and  district levels, including public,  private,  faith based  and  traditional healers
involved in providing health care services.

MoHSW will ensure that effective and adequate financial and administrative management systems and control
procedures are in place to ensure that all GoT and DP resources are disbursed and accounted for as planned.
MOHSW       will also establish  mechanisms     to provide adequate capacity,  linked   to  performance,  for  successful
program implementation, in consultation with the development partners (DPs).

Decentralisation will remain as one of the key principles for the organisation and management of the health sector to
HIV and AIDS.

Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the HSHSP will be conducted through appropriate systems,
procedures   and  mechanisms.     The   Monitoring    and  Evaluation    (M&E) Sub-Committee        of MoHSW       will be
responsible for providing advice on all matters concerning M&E.

The Health Management Information System (HMIS), Financial Administrative Management System (FAMS) and
other routine  systems   will be  the major tools   for data collection. Depending   on    the type and relevance   of  the
indicators, routine   monitoring  will be  undertaken,   on  a monthly,   quarterly, bi-annual    and  annual basis.   The
MOHSW and other agencies will primarily use this data and its analyses for decision making.               MOHSW         will
produce quarterly activity and financial reports for all levels of the health system for consideration at decision
making levels.     It will also produce an Annual Performance Review Report, on the performance of the sector
against annual plans and output targets.

MOHSW will be responsible for sector performance monitoring and review.         It will plan and lead the Joint Annual
Reviews (JAR), with appropriate involvement and support of the DP, other Government ministries and other key
stakeholders. The findings of the JAR will be presented at the first DPG meeting of each year.

There will be two evaluations during the duration of this plan. These will consist of a mid-term assessment after the
first 3 years of implementation and a comprehensive final evaluation in 2011.        All stakeholders will agree on the
timing, terms of reference and composition of these two review missions. All costs will be included in the Health
Sector Budget.

1.1.     COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND HISTORY

1.1.1    Introduction
         The Health Sector for HIV and AIDS Strategy - II 2008-2012 has been developed taking into account the
         following developments in Tanzania:
             Firstly, Tanzania AIDS      Commission    (TACAIDS)     who   has the  accountability  for developing   and
             adjusting the national multi sector HIV and AIDS strategy has developed a National HIV and AIDS
             Multi-sectoral Strategic Framework (NMSF 2008-2012). This framework lays out clearly the areas for
             concentration for the various sectors and provides guidance on the formulation of the sectoral plans for
             HIV   and  AIDS   according    to  their comparative   advantage:  By   addressing    HIV  and   AIDS   in a
             comprehensive and multi sectoral manner, the NMSF contributes to MDGs, universal access to HIV
             services, overall national development, poverty reduction and thus to the attainment of the aspiration
             laid out in the Vision 2025.

             Secondly, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) has the overall Health Sector Strategic
             Plan (HSSP-2008). The development of a new health sector strategy will include the HIV and AIDS.

             Thirdly, this new Health Sector Strategy on HIV and AIDS, spearheaded by MOHSW through the
             National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), is a continuation of the previous strategy which concluded
             at end of 2006.

         Therefore, this HSHSP 2008-2012 is a systematic approach of contributing to the:
             Operationalization of the TACAIDS NMSF 2008-2012.
             Operationalization of the current Ministry of Health Strategic Plan (HSSP-2008) and serve as an input
             into the anticipated new overall health sector strategy.
             Guidance of various implementers of Health Sector Strategy for HIV and AIDS at different levels.

         The management   intent    of the HSHSP    2008-2012   is not  to replace the need for    Partners, Regions and
         Districts to have their own plans, but rather to:
             Support coordinated, prioritised and knowledge-based scale up of the response.
             Facilitate broad  ownership     of the   response  by  all partners   and   practical partnerships  for the
             implementation of the response.
             Represent joint strategic direction of all Partners, Sectors, Regions and Districts.
             Enable the involvement of key sectors and decentralised levels in all stages of the process.
             Guide resource management at the strategic level.

1.1.2.   The Strategic Planning Process and Structure
         The HSHSP 2008-2012 has been built on the process of joint annual reviews of the progress with the current
         2003-2006 Health  Sector    Strategic Plan   for  HIV and  AIDS   and a   broad consultative  process  with the
         Partners, Sectors, Regions and districts. The approach used included data collection, review of literature,
         thematic group works, stakeholders consensus building workshops, field visits to Regions and districts and
         consolidation of the plan. The draft HSHSP was also presented and discussed at the stakeholder meetings of
         MOHSW and other fora.

1.1.3.   Geographic and Administrative Profile
         As of November 2007, Tanzania Mainland had 21 regions and about 124 districts.           Each district is divided
         into divisions, which in turn are composed, of 3-4 wards (5-7 villages form a ward).     The district is the most
         important administrative and implementation unit for public services.   For this reason the Ministry of Health
         and Social Welfare (MOHSW) in collaboration with the Prime Ministers Office Regional Administration
         and Local Government (PMORALG) through the Health Sector and Local Government reforms are currently
         strengthening the district health services, making the districts the focus for health development.

1.1.4.   Demographic and Socio-economic
         The Tanzania Mainland has an estimated 2007 population of 38,291,219 projected from the 2002 population
         Census. It has an annual population growth rate of 3.1%. Crude birth rate is 41.6 per 1,000 populations and
         life expectancy at birth is 52 years for men and 55 years for women. Twenty five percent (25%) of the
         population resides in urban areas whereas the majority (75%) of population is rural dwellers.

                                                                                                                        1

1.1.5.   General Health and Nutrition Status
         According to TDHS 2004-2005 report, the current infant mortality and under five-year are 68 and 112 per
         1,000 live births respectively whilst the maternal mortality is estimated at 578 deaths per 100,000 live births.
         The nutritional status shows a slight improvement, for instance stunting changed from 44% (2000) to 38%
         (2004/5) while wasting changed from 5% to 3% over the same period. The underweight improved from 29%
         to 22%.

1.1.6.   HIV and AIDS

1.1.6.1. Burden of disease
         The Tanzania HIV AND AIDS Indicator Survey (THIS) of 2003/4 shows that the predominant mode of
         transmission has remained heterosexual contact, constituting about 80% of all new infections. Mother to
         child transmission is estimated to account for about 18% of new infections. About 1.8% of young persons
         aged 15 to 24 who reported that they never had sex were found to be HIV positive. This suggests that they
         were  infected  through   blood   transfusion,  unsafe   injections          or traditional practices,   including  male
         circumcision or female genital cuttingi.

         Recent  studies indicate that in  some   parts of the  country,         transmission  through  anal  sexual  intercourse
         (heterosexual or among men who have sex with men) as well as HIV infection through drug abuse are
         occurring and may be important factors for the further spread of HIV.

         Tanzania  is facing a   ,,generalizedii  epidemic  of  HIV.  The          overall  prevalence  in    the  sexually active
         population (age 15 to 49) is 7.0%, with women being more affected than men (7.7% versus 6.3%).                      This
         results in a female/male ratio of 1.2 to 1.

           The distribution of the infection across the regions shows that there are 3 regions with adult prevalence
           above 10% (Mbeya, Iringa and Dar es Salaam), 7 regions with prevalence below 5% (Manyara, Kigoma,

                                                                                                                                 2

             Macro, TACAIDS, NBS

        As depicted in Figure 2 above, there is no single HIV epidemic in the country but probably several dozen
        of localised HIV epidemics which sometimes have a regional, sometimes only a district dimension.
        There are signs that the overall national figures are stabilizing and even going down slightly in the last five
        yearsiii.

1.1.6.2. Gender and HIV and AIDS
       It is estimated that there are about 840,000 women aged 15 to 49 years living with HIV representing 56% of
       the total  HIV infected        population. Additionally,      women       in this age group    account      for 60%  of  the new
       infections.

       While young men and women are equally infected in the age group 15 to 19 (2.1%), women aged 20 to 24
       are 1.4 times more likely than men of the same age group to be infected (6.0% women and 4.2% men are
       HIV+).    The prevalence in women peaks           in the age     group of  30 to 34 years,   while    it is highest for men in the
       age group 40 to 45. Adult prevalence in urban areas is 10.9% (12.0% for women and 9.6% for men), and the
       prevalence in rural areas is less than half at 5.3% (5.8% for women and 4.8% for men).

       The HIV epidemic is largely driven by unsafe sexual behaviour by males, on one hand, and by female
       subordination and lack of economic independence, on the other. For example, more than 70% of sexually
       active out-of-school girls reported granting sexual favors for basic daily needs, having relationships with
       older meniv.

                                                                                                                                      3
         The THIS report showed that, HIV prevalence is related to marital status in that, prevalence is lowest (1.9%)
         among respondents who had never been in a union and never had sex and highest (18.4%) among those who
         were formerly married. Discordance rate was at a magnitude of 8% among cohabitating couples, with more
         discordance in older couples and in urban compared to rural areas.

         Therefore, the most vulnerable group in Tanzania, as elsewhere in Africa, has been shown to be married
         women who are least likely to use or have protected sex. They are also most likely to be exposed to infection
         through concurrent sexual partners that either they or their husbands have.

         Since men assume more assertive and directive roles in sexual decision-making, they need to be addressed
         not only as beneficiaries but also as central in the fight against HIV and AIDS.

1.1.6.3. Impact of the AIDS Epidemic on health services
         The concrete impact of HIV and AIDS on the health sectors in term of additional morbidity and mortality
         (days and    years lost) is not known.    Anecdotal  evidence  suggests   that the rate of HIV     infection among
         employees of health is at least as high as that of the adult population as a whole.

         The already   over-stretched    health sector has  suffered multiple  effects  due to HIV      and AIDS: increased
         number    of patients due    to opportunistic   infections, increased demand     and  sometimes     reallocation of
         resources from other equally important health problems, and decreased number of health workers. Therefore
         there is serious impact on the health services in terms of quality of care as a result of increased service
         demand coupled with attrition of the workforce and stigma attached to HIV and AIDS.

         The average HIV+ adult in Tanzania has an average of 17 illness episodes before death, leading to healthcare
         costs per patient which can be twice the Tanzanian GDP of US$478 per capita.

1.2      HEALTH SECTOR RESPONSE TO HIV AND AIDS

1.2.1.   National Health System Response and Capacity
         The health system in Tanzania has two major components; the public and the private sector. The public share
         is 56%, the private share is 44% (which includes Faith Based Organizations (FBOs) 30% and private for

         health centre at the division level. As we move further we have the district and regional hospitals at district
         and regional levels.  At the zonal and national level are the consultant/ referral hospitals.

         Currently in Tanzania there are a total of 5,379 health facilities geographically distributed so that 70% of the
         population is within 5 km of a facility and 90% is within 10 km as at the end of 2005.v

         Administratively, the health system is largely decentralized. The MoHSW has direct responsibility for the
         referral  and  regional     hospitals, and regulatory   power  over   all health   facilities. To  accomplish  this
         responsibility, the Ministrys functions are divided into six directorates which include:Hospital Services,
         Preventive Services, Human Resource Development, Policy and Panning, Social Welfare, Adminstration and
         Personnel.   These  departments   are   further divided into sections for  a   more  effective   implementation  as

         within the parameters of the Preventive Services of MoHSW mandate through NACP.

         The district facilities are independently run by the PMORALG.

         Human resource
         The country is facing a serious human resource crisis. Between 1994 and 2005 the human resource has
         declined by 35.4%.      The shortages are best shown in Table 3.

         There are also serious imbalances in existing human resources between rural and urban areas.

1.2.2.   HIV and AIDS Control Strategies
         The National Response to HIV in Tanzania has evolved since 1985. Under the responsibility of the MOHSW
         and its    National    AIDS Control     Programme      (NACP)    supported by      World        Health Organisations (WHO)
         Global Programme on AIDS (GPA) several Short-term (STP) and Medium-Term Plans (MTPs) have been
         developed and implemented between 1985 and1991. (See Figure 4)

         During the implementation of the STPs and MTPs a number of achievements were realised including the
         strengthening of the health sector services to ensure safe blood transfusions, management of STIs, care of the
         infected and affected, as well as rising public awareness about the disease to over 95%. Despite these efforts,
         HIV infection rates continued to increase in the country, reaching its peak in the mid 90s.

         Starting with the MTP II (1992 - 1996) efforts were undertaken, to work towards a broader national response
         involving sectors like education, labour, and agriculture for the first time, as well as collaborating more
         intensively with NGOs and bilateral and international agencies. From 2000 the responsibility of coordinating
         the national response was shifted to the Prime Ministers Office under TACAIDS.

                                                                                                                                       5
            In 2002, the Health Sector Strategy for HIV and AIDS (2003-2006) was developed, followed in 2004 with
            the first National      HIV      and AIDS      Care     and   Treatment     Plan (NCTP)            which    ushered      in     large-scale
            antiretroviral treatment for PLHIV in the country.

1.2.3.      Programmatic and financial gaps

1.2.3.1     Programmatic gaps
            The  major     programmatic       gaps include    coverage       and quality     of   services       and    the weak         referral and
            coordination system between institutions. Some key programmes are indicated in the Table 4 below. Efforts
            have been made to date to design, build support for and implement effective referral networks that respect
            confidentiality and patient choice while creating a continuity of care and support.

1.3.     VISION, MISSION, GOALS AND KEY PRINCIPLES

1.3.1.   Vision 2025
         The long term vision for Tanzanias development is reflected in "Vision 2025". The key focus of the vision
         is reflected in the main objective of the MKUKUTA which is "To reduce the incidence of absolute poverty
         to 10% and relative poverty to 30% of the total population by the year 2017".

         The Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategy is a major contributor to the attainment of the vision of the
         overall multi-sectoral response expressed in the National Multi-sectoral Strategic Framework for HIV and
         AIDS i.e.

         "Tanzania united in its efforts to reduce the spread of HIV and to provide the best available care for those
         infected and affected by the virus."

1.3.2.   Mission
         The Mission of the Health Sector in contributing to the National Vision is

         Working in partnership with other public sectors, private sector, civil society and communities to play a
         leading role in the prevention of further spread of HIV and AIDS and mitigate its impacts by providing
         essential interventions and quality care.

1.3.3.   Goals
         In this connection, the Health Sector has defined the following goals for its response to HIV and AIDS:
             To scale up the health sector response to HIV and AIDS and strengthen the health system capacity to
             support HIV and AIDS interventions,
             To promote access and utilization of affordable and essential interventions and commodities for HIV
             and AIDS, and
             To improve the quality of HIV and AIDS interventions to the general public, PLHIV, health care
             providers and other vulnerable populations.

         The three goals of the heath sector response will be attained through objectives, strategies, interventions and
         activities in four main Thematic Areas: Prevention, Treatment, Care and Support, Cross-cutting Issues and
         Health System Strengthening.

1.3.4.   Key principles
         A number of principles will guide the implementation of this strategy. These include concern for quality,
         ethical conduct, human rights, gender and equity.

          Equity of access:      Equity considerations constitute the basis for the interventions identified in this
                                 strategy and how they have to be scaled up. This is particularly the case with ART,
                                 which need to be a component of a continuum of care.
          Ethical conduct and    People should be allowed to make informed decisions. There are major ethical and
          human rights           human rights issues involved not only in medical interventions but also in other
                                 health interventions such as Communication and Education.
          Quality                Although the ultimate goal will be to scale-up HIV services and interventions, due
                                 recognition will be given to quality. Concern for quality will precede quantity
                                 consideration. Existing services and interventions have to be consolidated prior to
                                 expansion. Thus quality training will precede interventions, materials have to be in
                                 place before services or interventions are promoted. Similarly assessment and
                                 reviews are to be undertaken before a given intervention is recommended for
                                 scaling up.
          Accountability:        Accountability for the resources utilised, services provided and to the communities
                                 served at all levels of health service delivery.
          Partnerships:          Partnership with all the stakeholders, taking full advantages of the synergies
                                 provided by each stakeholder group.
          Decentralisation:      Devolution of key responsibilities, including planning, organization, coordination
                                 and control of healthcare delivery, and resources from the centre to the districts
                                 and hospitals, where health services are provided.
          Leadership:            Appropriate, efficient and effective leadership in the implementation of the
                                 strategic plan, at all stages of the healthcare delivery system.
          Gender                 Gender imbalances underlie the pattern of response to illness and health care
                                 seeking behaviour. They also affect how care and other forms of support are
                                 provided.

                                                                                                                      9
1.3.5.   Main Assumptions
         The main assumptions for the successful implementation of this plan are:
             Continued peace and political stability in the country;
             Availability of adequate numbers of appropriately trained and well motivated health workers;
             Macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth;
             Increased Government prioritisation and funding to the health sector;
             Increased Partners support to other programmes within the health sector; and
             Timely and appropriate attention to implementation of all health priority areas.

1.3.6.   National HIV and AIDS Priority Areas
         The lesson learnt from implementation of the 2003-2006 plan is that it is critical for the new Health Sector
         Strategy for HIV and AIDS to identify and concentrate on a limited number of national HIV priority areas,
         rather than attempt to include "everything that needs to be done" in the strategic plan.   Failure or lack of
         prioritisation in the plan would not provide for the degree of focus and concentration of efforts and resources
         required to deal with the critical areas requiring such attention.

         Though the lesson is acknowledged and the fact that a strategic plan usually addresses only strategies without
         going deep into activities, this plan has included activities which are part of the matrices in the Annex for the
         following reasons:
             Firstly, the set of activities will serve as a menu that accommodates the interests of various stakeholders
             involved in the health sector response. This means that different activities or interventions may be
             important for different stakeholders.
             Secondly, carrying out the prioritization exercise is better done at activities level. A possible tool that
             can be used to assess the feasibility of interventions by each sector or organization as they develop their
             operational or annual plans is suggested below:

                  NARRATIVE AND JUSTIFICATION OF THE MATRICES

2.1.     THEMATIC AREA I: PREVENTION

2.1.1    Introduction
         The HIV epidemic in Tanzania is the result of a complex interplay between biological, socio-cultural and
         socio-economic factors. The strategies outlined here aim to decrease the risk of infection among the general
         population, with special attention to young people, both through enhancing knowledge and skills and through
         making relevant health services more accessible and youth friendly. The health sector at the community level
         will contribute towards a dialogue about sexuality, gender roles and cultural practices in order to initiate
         critical reflection and action to reduce local factors that increase vulnerability to HIV.

         Availability   of relevant  health services, such  as management    of  Sexually  Transmitted   Infections, HIV
         Testing and Counselling (HTC), Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) and safe blood will
         be further expanded while safeguarding the quality and ensuring gender sensitivity.         Condoms, both male
         and female, will be made available in all health facilities. Further more, additional innovative outlets and
         channels will be established to increase availability and accessibility of condoms to the general population.

         The available evidence shows that financial resources allocated to broad prevention programmes have a
         range of positive effects on public health in general. A comprehensive review of literature concludes that
         "broad primary prevention programmes are at least 28 times more cost-effective than HAART, and that
         broad primary prevention has a range of positive spin-off effects on public health and disease control in
         general and no known side-effects." Therefore an intensified and comprehensive prevention programme is
         very critical.

2.1.2    Intervention Area 1:        Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV

2.1.2.1  Preamble
         Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) has become a crucial intervention in the
         global fight against the epidemic. In Tanzania about 1.4 million women become pregnant each year. Data
         from ANC     HIV   sentinel surveillance sites in  Tanzania  (2005) indicate that the overall   HIV  prevalence
         among  pregnant     women    attending   antenatal  clinics  is  8.2%.  When   effectively    and  appropriately
         implemented, PMTCT services have the potential to prevent infection in babies who would otherwise be
         born HIV-positive or contract the infection during delivery and breast feeding.

         Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV core interventions include:
              Information on testing and counselling on preventing HIV transmission (Primary prevention).
              Access to family planning services for women living with HIV and AIDS and their partners. (Prevent
              unintended pregnancies).
              Use of antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV transmission from mother to child.
              Access to HIV treatment, care and support for infected mothers, infants and other family members.

         In order to provide the above PMTCT intervention will be:
            Implemented      through   multi-sectoral   and    multidisciplinary  approaches   necessitating   effective
            coordination and partnerships of all actors under government leadership, and involving all stakeholders in
            the public, private and NGO sectors, civil society and PLWHA in the planning, implementation and
            monitoring of programmes.
            Delivered as part of comprehensive RCH and HIV and AIDS packages and will therefore be integrated
            with other relevant RCH services (ANC, delivery, PNC, EPI, IMCI, FP) and HIV and AIDS services
            (prevention including client and provider-initiated counselling and testing, care, support and HIV and
            AIDS treatment including OI and ART).
            Based on scientifically and ethically sound approaches.
            Of high quality and provided at all levels of health system.

                                                                                                                      11
2.1.2.2  Situation Analysis

         For the year 2007:
             A total of 1347 health facilities were providing PMTCT services.
             A total of 713,506( 48%)    new ANC attendees received PMTCT services
             About 91.6% (713,506 of 778,619) of these new ANC attendees were tested for HIV.
             Of those tested, 9.9% (70,710 of 713,506) were found to be HIV positive, which is slightly higher than
             8.2% HIV prevalence from the 2005 ANC sentinel surveillance results.
             About 60% (42,595 of 70,710) of those found to be HIV positive through the programme received
             nevirapine prophylaxis (at ANC and L&D),
             HIV exposed babies who received nevirapine syrup prophylaxis were 30% (21,358/ 70,710)
             Despite this progress in specific programmatic      terms, at the end of 2007, only 34% (42,595/ 123,738)  of
             HIV positive pregnant women in the country received antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce MTCT

2.1.2.2.1 Achievements
         A lot of progress has been made to in the rolling out of PMTCT interventions in the country.
             The   number    of health   facilities providing    PMTCT   Services    has increased from  5 pilot sites  in
             September 2000 to 1347 by December 2007.
             Key programmatic documents have been developed and disseminated including:
              -  PMTCT Guidelines (2004, Revised 2007)
              -  PMTCT Training Materials (2004, Revised 2007)
              -  PMTCT Monitoring Tools (2004, Revised 2007)
              -  PMTCT Managers Orientation Guide (2006)
              -  Draft advocacy package for PMTCT interventions (2007)

             The programme has trained 254 TOTs at regional and district levels to support training of HCWs.
             The programme together with PMTCT implementing partners has trained 3,856 health care workers in
             the existing PMTCT sites.

2.1.2.2.2 Challenges/gaps/emerging issues

            Aspects          Challenges for PMTCT
            Availability         Only 1347 health facilities out of a total of 4871 RCH clinics are also providing
                                 PMTCT services.
                                 Only 34% of HIV positive pregnant women are receiving ARV prophylaxis.
                                 Only 30% of exposed babies         received ARV prophylaxis.

            Equitable            Weak referral system within and outside the health facilities,
            access           -   Patient   ART      eligibility assessment is only   conducted  in the CTC    centres thus
                                 requiring all HIV positive pregnant women to be referred to the nearest CTC centre.

                                 Only 6.3% of rural women aged 15 to 49 who were pregnant in the past 2 year were
                                 offered and accepted HIV test during antenatal clinics. (THIS, 2004).

2.1.2.3  Equity, gender and sustainability considerations
             Women confront a number of gender-based obstacles in accessing PMTCT services such as, using
             ARV prophylaxis or engaging in alternative infant feeding practices.
             The   role  of  men    in facilitating and supporting    women      in preventing HIV,  fighting stigma  and
             discrimination at home and at the community level is of crucial importance and needs to be addressed.
             Limited resources to accelerate PMTCT efforts from Government, Partners and the community.

2.1.2.4  Strategic Objectives
         Increase the percentage of HIV positive pregnant women who receive ARVs from 34% in 2007 to 80% by
         2012 to reduce the transmission of HIV from mothers to their children, during pregnancy, birth and/or breast-
         feeding and ensure access to care and treatment for mothers and babies.
         1.  Advocate    for and    increase awareness  and     commitment    to addressing PMTCT    and  paediatric  HIV
             prevention care, treatment and support among key stakeholders, including partners, policy makers and
             leaders at all levels.

                                                                                                                       12
         2.  Strengthen the provision of quality PMTCT and paediatric HIV prevention care, treatment and support
             integrated into maternal new born and child health services to all health facility levels.

         3.  Improve delivery of community PMTCT and paediatric HIV prevention care, treatment and support and
             referral of HIV-infected women, their children and families.

2.1.2.5  Targets:
         1.  At least 90% of all reproductive and child health services provide comprehensive PMTCT services by
             2012.

         2.  At  least   80%  of all pregnant women    get access  to  standard  Package   of PMTCT       (provided  with
             information   to prevent  HIV  transmission,  tested for HIV   and counselled,   receive   family  planning
             services, infant feeding counselling and support)

         3.  At least 80% of pregnant women living with HIV and their babies receive ARV prophylaxis for MTCT
             prevention

         4.  At least 80% of infants born to women living with HIV receive co-trimoxazole prophylaxis.

         5.  At least 50% of male partners of women tested for HIV through PMTCT are counselled and tested for
             HIV.

         6.  At least 80% of children born to women living with HIV are tested for HIV using either Antibody Test
             or DNA PCR).

2.1.2.6  Indicators:
         1.  Number of health facilities offering PMTCT services
         2.  % of HIV infected       women  receiving  ARV  to reduce   the risk of  MTCT     (stratified by  single dose
             Nevirapine SDV) vs more efficacious regimens)
         3.  % of identified exposed babies receiving ARV prophylaxis
         4.  %/number infants born to HIV infected women started on Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis at 12 months of
             age
         5.  % of male partners of women tested for HIV through PMTCT who are tested for HIV.
         6.  %/number of children born to HIV infected women who received an HIV test within the past 12 month
             (by Antibody Test/DNA PCR)

2.1.2.7  Key Implementers:
         MoHSW,   TACAIDS,       NACOPHA,     Public, Private  and  FBO   Hospitals, Regional   and District    Councils,
         Health Management Teams, Partners, PMORALG

2.1.3    Intervention Area 2a:   Prevention of Sexual Transmission of HIV:      STI Prevention and Management

2.1.3.1  Preamble
         Adequate treatment of patients with STIs and their partners can reduce the rate of transmission of HIV in the
         population, as  has  been demonstrated  in a  community    based STI   intervention  study done     in Mwanza,
         Tanzania in 1995. Furthermore, it reduces the reproductive ­ tract and obstetric complications associated
         with STIs. Interventions for STIs have therefore been considered essential in HIV prevention programmes.
         However, the public in general, particularly young people, tend to be ill-informed about STIs. According to
         Demographic     and Health  Survey (DHS)   2004-2005,    about 11%  of  the sexual   population    contact  STIs
         annually while it is assumed that, only 60% utilise the existing STIs services.

         The Surveillance of HIV and Syphilis Infection among Antenatal Mothers in the RCH, 2005/2006 indicates
         the overall syphilis sero-prevalence of 6.9% (Surveillance of HIV and Syphilis Infections among antenatal
         clinic attendees 2005/2006).

2.1.3.2  Situation analysis
         The following   achievements  and  challenges were   encountered   during the   implementation    of 2003-2006
         strategic plan:

                                                                                                                      13
2.1.3.2.1 Achievements
             All public hospitals including Referral, Regional, District and District Designated Hospitals, Health
             Centres and 66% of the dispensaries provide STI syndromic case management services.
             To achieve the goal of the STI control programme, the NACP in the period 2003-2006 continued to
             work in collaboration with the government structures, communities and a number of non-governmental
             agencies.
             Some FBOs and NGOs including private health facilities also provided STIs services.
             A total of 8,378 Health care providers have been trained in STI syndromic case management.
             Developed National Guidelines for the Management     of STI/Reproductive Tract Infections
             Over 564 Health Care Workers from Antenatal Clinics trained in management of syphilis in pregnancy
             under NACP coordination.
             Developed,   produced  and distributed  a variety of educational materials      (posters, leaflets and video
             tapes) on STI prevention and control
             About 67.2% of service providers made correct choice of drugs, dosage and duration of treatment for
             their clients (NACP survey 2005)

2.1.3.2.2 Challenges

          Aspects             Challenges      in STI prevention and management
          Availability             Inadequate screening for syphilis in RCH services
                                   Inadequate condom promotion and distribution
                                   Poor coordination of STI control activities at all levels
                                   Inadequate STI drugs,syphilis screening tests and other related medical supplies
                                   STI drugs are used for management of other illnesses that require antibiotics
          Equitable access         Quality assurance for STI control is low especially in remote areas and in private
                                   facilities
                                   Few youth friendly reproductive health services
                                   STI services addressing high risk population groups are limited.
          Quality                  Poor reporting system
                                   STI commodities ordering system (indent) not adhered to in some districts hence
                                   irregular distribution, delays, stock outs has been reported at health facility level
                                   Weak monitoring of aetiologies and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of STI
                                   pathogens
                                   Self medication leading to inappropriate management and complications
                                   Poor contact tracing (21-35%

2.1.3.2.3 Emerging issues
             There appears to be a shift of interest among partners in supporting STI programme, very few are
             willing to support the programme.
             Shortage of HCWs at the facility level coupled with increased HIV interventions has resulted into
             displacement of previously trained HCWs from the STI clinics to other HIV services         such as PMTCT,
             Care and Treatment and VCT
             Sexual violence and abuse especially for young girls and boys remains a problem
             Emerging new syphilis screening tests to reduce the challenges of cold storage in rural setting but will
             imply retraining of the health care workers

2.1.3.3  Equity, gender and Sustainability Considerations
         STIs like gonorrhoea are acute and symptomatic in most males, but may be asymptomatic (up to 60%) in
         many women. Other STIs like Trichomoniasis have symptoms in women, but remain often asymptomatic in
         males indicating the need of specific attention of HCWs in dealing with STIs and sex differences. HIV,
         Syphilis and gonorrhoea can also be transmitted by the pregnant woman to her new born baby. HCWs will
         need to increasingly seek laboratory confirmations in cases where symptoms do not exist but circumstantial
         evidence of infection exists. It is also important to differentiate between RTIs which may not be sexually
         transmitted when managing female clients. Labelling such clients as having STIs may be stigmatizing and
         cause marital disharmony.

         STI prevention and education, efforts must be undertaken to empower girls and women to decide on the
         sexual relations they want and to resist pressure by men and also measures must be found to empower young
         boys to resist pressure from older women.

                                                                                                                     14
2.1.3.4  Strategic Objective
         To expand quality comprehensive STI services and enhance appropriate utilization of services.
        Strategies:
        1.  Expand coverage of quality comprehensive STI services to all public, FBO and private health facilities
            and make the services user friendly particularly for youth and other vulnerable population
        2.  Assure quality for STI services (clinical aspects).
        3   Improve STI programme management and coordination at all levels.

2.1.3.5  Targets
        Increase the percentage  of  STI  patients attending health  care facilities who are appropriately   diagnosed,
        treated and counselled according to national guidelines from 67% in 2005 to 80% by 2012.

            1.   Number of STI cases treated annually
            2008              2009             2010                       2011                     2012

2.1.4              Intervention area 2b:  Prevention of Sexual Transmission of    HIV:   Male Circumcision

2.1.4.1  Preamble
         The association of  male    circumcision  and reduced   HIV  prevalence  has  been  reported   in a number of
         observational studiesvi. Three randomized controlled trials conducted in South Africa and the neighbouring
         countries of Kenya and Uganda on male circumcision and HIV transmission have demonstrated a 50-60%
         decrease in the risk of acquiring HIV infection among men who underwent circumcision during the trial
         compared to those who  were not circumcisedvii. Therefore there is compelling global evidence that   safe male
         circumcision should be one of the public health interventions to reduce the transmission of HIV especially in
         countries with high HIV and AIDS burden and low male circumcision prevalence. Furthermore, other studies
         have demonstrated a number of other health benefits of male circumcision including reduction of: RTIs in
         children, Genital Ulcer Disease, cervical and penile carcinoma. Reported social benefits include increased
         sexual pleasure in both partners and personal hygiene.

                                                                                                                    15
2.1.4.2  Situation Analysis
         The practice of male circumcision in Tanzania is often for religious and cultural reasons rather than for the
         purpose of HIV prevention. Modernization and peer pressure have been documented as other reasons for
         male circumcision. Medical indications for male circumcision include phimosis and paraphimosis. In most
         regions and districts this is done in health facilities but in some districts traditional male circumcision is still
         being practiced. In Tanzania, male circumcision is commonly practiced in many communities and the overall
         prevalence is about 70% (THIS 2003/04).

         Though    THIS  findings indicated that   the difference between   HIV  prevalence  among  circumcised     and
         uncircumcised men was not significant (7% versus 6%), ecological comparison from the same study show a
         pattern of lower HIV prevalence in circumcising than in non-circumcising belts. For example the high HIV-
         prevalence regions of Mbeya and Iringa have relatively low male circumcision rates (34.4% and 37.7%
         respectively) compared to Manyara with male circumcision rate of above 80%.and HIV prevalence of 2%.

2.1.4.2.1 Challenges

           Aspects           Challenges for Male Circumcision
           Availability           Male circumcision has not been institutionalized as a routine service for health
                                  benefits and now HIV prevention
                                  Health services are already overburdened and scaling up of male circumcision needs
                                  to consider improvement of health systems
           Equitable access       Prevalence, determinants,   acceptability and practices of male  circumcision    vary
                                  across regions and districts but has not been well documented
                                  Costs incurred to access MC may become a barrier to scaling up the service for poor
                                  people who need the service
           Quality                Substantial male circumcision is done by traditional practitioners where complete
                                  removal of prepuce,   and safety may not be ensured

2.1.4.3  Equity, gender and sustainability considerations
         Due consideration should be made prior to rolling out male circumcision programmes to ensure that other
         health services including HIV interventions do not suffer.
         Special attention needs to be paid to the involvement of women as mothers and sexual partners in advocacy
         and mobilization initiatives for male circumcision.

         The public should be well informed about the importance of male circumcision
2.1.4.4  Strategic Objective
         To promote medically safe accepted male circumcision for health benefits and as a preventive measure
         against HIV transmission

        Strategies
        1.  Establish national policy framework for coordination and implementation of male circumcision
        2.  Public advocacy and mobilization for male circumcision
        3.  Expansion of male circumcision services in the country

2.1.4.5  Targets
        1.  Strategic framework for male circumcision in place by end of 2009
        2.  Raise prevalence of male circumcision from the current 70% to 80% by 2012

2.1.5    Intervention Area 3a:    Prevention of Transmission in    Health-Care Settings: Safe Blood

2.1.5.1  Preamble
         HIV transmission through blood-transfusion, contaminated blood-products, occupational exposure in          health
         care settings as well as through traditional practices (skin piercing, female genital mutilation, unsafe male
         circumcision) account only for a relatively low percentage of the overall transmission. However, reduction of
         transmission risks in these settings is of importance to safeguard the health of the population in general and
         of the health service providers.

         The MOHSW       has  continued   to ensure that  blood transfusion   is safe in all levels of health  services  by
         screening    blood for Transfusion   Transmissible   Infections (TTIs)   which  include  HIV,  HBV,    HCV      and
         syphilis. Health   care workers     have also been   trained on  injection   safety  and   proper hospital waste
         management.

2.1.5.2  Situation analysis
2.1.5.2.1 Achievements
             Donor blood screening for HIV started in 1987 and the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS)
             was established in 2000.
             By September 2007, six zonal blood transfusion centres which constitute NBTS had been established in
             Dar-es-Salaam, Moshi, Mwanza, Mbeya, Tabora and Mtwara. The seventh centre is under construction
             in Dodoma.
             A database of low risk voluntary blood donors has been established in every region.
             Various guidelines have been developed:
              -    National Blood Transfusion Policy, June 2006
              -    Blood Donor Recruitment and Retention guidelines,
              -    Specific Blood Transfusion Practice guidelines.
              -    Clinical use of Blood and Blood Products.

2.1.5.2.2 Challenges

          Aspects                Challenges for Blood Safety
          Availability              Limited numbers of voluntary, repeating non remunerated blood donors.
          Equitable access          Weak     distribution of donated  blood   and  blood  products  by  Zonal   centers  to
                                    regional and district distribution points
                                    Low blood storage capacity at regional and district levels.
          Quality                   Lack of Quality Assurance scheme for NBTS at distribution points.
                                    Inadequate supervision of blood transfusion practices in private hospitals.
2.1.5.3  Equity, gender and sustainability considerations
         Currently the majority of blood donors are replacement donors (90%), out of whom majority are males
         (81.4%)viii. Half of blood recipients are children followed by pregnant women (30%).

2.1.5.4  Strategic objective
         To increase supply of safe blood from 15% to 50% of the blood transfusing hospitals by 2012.
         Strategies
         1.  Strengthen the distribution capacity of NBTS at all levels.
         2.  Promote community awareness for blood donation.
         3.  Strengthen the M&E system and Quality Assurance scheme for NBTS.

2.1.5.5  Target
         1.  Increase low risk blood donations from baseline to 70% in public and private hospitals

2.1.6    Intervention Area 3b:    Prevention of Transmission in Health-Care Settings: Workplace Interventions
         for Health Care Workers (HCW)

2.1.6.1  Preamble
         HCWs may acquire infection at places of work as an occupational risk or through sexual networking. In
         health care settings, universal bio-safety precautions and safe waste management is essential for prevention
         of nosocomial transmission of infectious agents.

2.1.6.2  Situation Analysis

2.1.6.2.1 Achievements by December 2007
        a)  Universal precautions and medical waste management;
                 Guidelines for national hospital waste management have been developed and are being observed in
                 most health facilities in the country.
                 Health facilities have different means of disposing waste such as incinerators and pits.
                 There are satisfactory initiatives to intensify advocacy and sensitize health workers on issues related
                 to HIV transmission risks at the workplace.

        b)  Safe injections
                 Safe disposal of needles and sharps is practiced in health facilities in special boxes or improvised
                 alternatives.
                 HCW have been trained on safe injection procedures as part of the Infection Prevention Programme
                 of the MOHSW.

        c)  Workplace interventions for HCWs
                 The Occupational Unit of the MOHSW has developed a strategic plan for the control of HIV and
                 AIDS for HCW at the workplace for the period 2006-2011.
                 MOHSW developed National Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Guidelines for health care
                 services in Tanzania in 2004.
                 12,000 healthcare workers in 143 health facilities were trained on IPC.

        d)  Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
                 PEP is available in all care and  treatment  clinics where ARVs    are provided .

2.1.6.2.2 Challenges

            Aspects          Challenges for Workplace Interventions for HCW
            Availability        Limited awareness about risks of HIV transmission in hospital settings
                                Limited utilization of PEP.
                                Inadequate coverage of HIV work place interventions in health facilities
            Equitable           Inadequate knowledge and skills among healthcare providers on IPC.
            access              PEP services are available in only 200 Health facilities out of 5,379.
            Quality             Inadequate functioning    of National  Quality    Improvement  Committee     (NQIC) on
                                infection control
                                Lack of harmonized training materials on Infection IPC
                                No coordination forum for IPC

2.1.6.3  Equity, Gender and sustainability considerations
         Most of Health   care workers who are     exposed   to occupational  harzards   are  women, therefore   they
         should be  empowered to protect themselves.
         Workplace interventions should focus all levels of health system. Special considerations should therefore be
         given to gender related issues such as sexual harassment where it exist.

2.1.6.4  Strategic Objective
         To implement comprehensive workplace interventions in the health sector focused on the prevention, care,
         treatment and support of employees, employers and their families.

         Strategies
         1. Strengthen and promote Health Sector workplace HIV interventions.

2.1.7    Intervention area 4a: Vulnerable Population Groups: Targeted Youth Programmes

2.1.7.1  Preamble
         Young people aged 10 to 24 constitute a third of the Tanzanian population. About 4% of women aged 15-24
         and 3%   of men  15-24   are HIV positive.  (TDHS  2004-2005).      Prevention of HIV in young people is an
         investment  that will ensure  future  HIV-free  generations.    In Tanzania 22%  of 15-19  year-old   girls are
         marriedix. Further research shows that more than 30% of sexually active girls had a coerced sexual debut.x
         Once they become sexually active, young people tend to have multiple partnersxi. About 52% of female19
         years old, had been pregnant or had had a child, and almost half of these had no formal educationxii. Nearly a
         third of the  victims of unsafe  abortion  were teenagers,   of whom   almost half  were 17 years of   age   or
         youngerxiii. Females and males aged 15-24 had had sex before 15 and 18 years respectively. Twelve percent
         of young women and 9% of young men had had sex by age 15. (TDHS 2004-2005). Young people must be
         proactive to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies as well as HIV AND AIDS and other Sexually
         Transmitted Infections

2.1.7.2  Situation Analysis

2.1.7.2.1 Achievements
            IEC and BCC interventions implemented by MoHSW and development partners.
            Youth friendly services established by MoHSW and development partners.
            NGOs initiated programmes targeting displaced young girls and boys.
            ASRH strategy, training package and advocacy materials developed.
            Advocacy for youth friendly reproductive health services has been     implemented in 10 regions (Mtwara,
            Morogro, Kilimanjaro, Shinyanga, Mwanza, Dar es Salaam, Kigoma, Singida, Arusha and Manyara).
            250 HCWs trained on Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health (ASRH) friendly services.

2.1.7.2.2 Challenges
          Aspects              Challenges for Targeted Youth Programmes
          Availability            HIV and AIDS interventions addressing young people are insufficient

          Equitable access        IEC and BCC interventions on ASRH and HIV interventions targeting young people
                                  are insufficient
                                  ASRH and HIV services are not easily accessible to young people
                                  Sexually active adolescents are not well informed on the importance of seeking
                                  health care and protecting themselves

                                  Majority of IEC interventions use ineffective channels of communication for
                                  effective behavioural change

2.1.7.3  Equity, gender and Sustainability Considerations
         Young women and girls are more vulnerable than young men to acquire the AIDS virus due to biological,
         socio-economic and cultural reasons. Additionally there is an increasing intergenerational sexual practice
         between older males and young girls, and older women and young boys. On this basis, programmes must aim

                                                                                                                     19
         to empower young women and boys to make their own independent informed decisions about their sexuality
         options and preferences with regards to safe sex practices.

2.1.7.4  Strategic Objective
         To increase adolescents access, participation and utilization of innovative integrated and high quality health
         services
         Strategies
         1.   Ensure availability of effective HIV- ASRH interventions for youth
         2.   Promote positive attitude and behaviour change in communities among parents and adolescents through
              behaviour change communication strategy
         3.   Strengthen management and coordination mechanism for HIV and ASRH services at all levels.

2.1.7.5  Targets
         1.   To reduce HIV prevalence among women and men aged 15-24 years from 2.4 percent in 2008 to 1.4

2.1.8.1  Intervention area 4b: Most At Risk Populations (MARPs): CSW, MSM, mobile workers, IDUs,

2.1.8.2  Preamble
         Vulnerability to  HIV  infection is substantially higher in  specific population groups  than in the   general
         sexually active population. This is either related directly to their occupational activities (sex workers), their
         social and cultural marginalization (MSM), or their professions which bring them in frequent contacts with
         places of sexual mixing (bar maids). Such occupations necessitate longer periods of separation from families
         or stable relationships (migrant workers including miners, military) or complete breakdown of stable social
         environment   (refugees, intravenous  drug users).  These   groups  need special  attention because  of  their
         importance in the dynamics of the epidemic when they act as a bridge for transmission from their sub group
         to the general population.

         a.  Men who have sex with men
         Although it is widely spoken, there is no hard data regarding MSM although MSM practices have been
         reported in institutional settings. However, MSM have not been considered to any great extent in national
         HIV and AIDS interventions. MSM behaviours and sexualities may include bisexuality, and HIV epidemic
         amongst MSM and the heterosexual HIV epidemic are thus interconnected.

         b.   Sex Workers
         Sex workers are predominantly female and are at very high risk of HIV infection and are vulnerable due to
         multiple sexual networks and limited capacity to ensure safe sex during each and every sexual encounter.

         c.  Injecting drug use (IDU)
         Injecting drug use has long been recognized as a high risk practice for HIV transmission as needles and
         syringes may   be shared   between  users without  sterilization. The  extent of IDU  in Tanzania   is under-
         researched.

2.1.8.3  Situation analysis
         Drug use enhances the risk of HIV infections either directly or indirectly by lowering inhibitions, which lead
         to risky behaviours. The results of THIS (2003-2004) showed that there were higher prevalence of HIV,
         especially when the alcohol use is by the female partner ­overall was 8% (13.7% women and 6.9% men).

                                                                                                                  20
         The spread of HIV is associated with all forms of drug use including smoking, alcohol use, inhalation and
         drug injecting. In particular, drug in-take through shared syringes poses a higher risk of HIV infection.

         A study carried out in 2001 in Dar-es-salaam, in densely populated area, indicated that 18% of drug users are
         IDUs. More recent studies revealed that between 31% and 42%xiv of IDUs are HIV positive and the situation
         is more serious among females.

2.1.8.3.1 Achievements
              Some studies have been conducted on the magnitude of HIV infection among some vulnerable groups
              and their characteristics.

2.1.8.3.2 Challenges

          Aspects             Challenges for MARPs
          Availability            Inadequate data on the characteristics, risk taking behaviours, magnitude, social-
                                  economic- situation of MARPs.
                                  Lack of tolerant policies for these groups (since they are largely marginalized
                                  and discriminated in society, their behaviors are not legal and they are subjected
                                  to criminal prosecution).
                                  Lack of intervention package focusing on MARPs
          Equitable access        Inability   to access  various services due  to perceived    socially and  legally
                                  unacceptable behaviours.
          Quality                 Poor coordination mechanism among implementers of MARPs activities
                                  Lack of standardized guidelines for training on HIV issues to MARPs.

2.1.8.4  Equity, Gender and sustainability considerations
         Most sex   workers  are in this   occupation  due to economic    and social constraints.   For some  reason,
         stigmatization of sex work does not extend to the customers who in most cases are males.
         For substance abusers females are more vulnerable than males due to multiple partners and forced sex.

2.1.8.5  Strategic objective
         To prevent transmission of HIV among MARPs.

         Strategies
         1.   Advocacy for policy change for MARPs.
         2.   Support research studies on the magnitude and characteristics of MARPs
         3.   Ensure availability of effective HIV risk reduction interventions for MARPs.
         4.   Establish public - private partnership with appropriate stakeholders dealing with MARPs

2.1.9    Intervention area 5: Prevention Services for People Living with HIV and AIDS (Positive Prevention)

2.1.9.1  Preamble
         Positive prevention aims at assisting people living with HIV and AIDS to take measures that avoid exposing
         others to  infection as well as   avoiding  re-infectionxv. Re-infection has a negative  impact      on disease
         pathogenesis. If preventive measures are not undertaken by PLHIV, infection may be transmitted to others
         including discordant couples. Also, if PLHIV get re infected with new types of viruses, this can aggravate the
         progression of the infection. Data from Tanzania (THIS 2003/2004) revealed that up to 8% of couples in the
         country have discordant HIV sero-statusxvi. This calls for the need to promote positive prevention. Stigma is
         still a bottleneck in making PLHIV access care and treatment services. Major stigma incidences are observed
         in health care settings and in communities.

2.1.9.2  Situation Analysis

2.1.9.2.1 Achievement
             Number    of  people  who   have  undergone     HIV Counselling   and   Testing Services has      increased
             significantly. Between July and December 2007 about 3.2 million people were tested.
             Free HIV care and treatment services offered to eligible PLHIV.
             National umbrella/apex organization for PLHIV established
             Establishment of support groups and post test clubs is on the increase.
             Number of PLHIV who have disclosed their serostatus has increased

2.1.9.2.2 Challenges

          Aspects              Challenges for positive prevention for PLHIV and stigma reduction
          Availability            Inadequate meaningful engagement and involvement of PLHIV for Positive
                                  Prevention.
                                  Inadequate integration of positive prevention in the available care and treatment
                                  services
          Equitable access        Inability to access the few available services due to stigma and non disclosure of
                                  the intended beneficiaries
          Quality                 Unavailability of national guidelines for positive prevention

2.1.9.3   Equity, Gender and sustainability considerations
                Two thirds of people accessing CTC services are women suggesting a need to identify reasons for low
                male involvement.

2.1.9.4  Strategic Objective
         To reduce the risk of PLHIV getting re-infection or infecting others from HIV.

         Strategies
         1.  Encourage meaningful involvement of PLHIV at all levels.
         2.  Support individually focused health promotion to enhance disclosure of HIV positive status.
         3.  Integrate positive prevention in prevention, care, treatment and support services at all levels.
         4.  Encourage couple counselling and testing and other care and treatment services.

2.1.9.5  Targets
         1.  National guidelines for meaningful involvement of PLHIV (MIPA) developed.
         2.  Increase the number of   couple who are counselled and tested

2.2.            THEMATIC AREA II:                  CARE AND TREATMENT

2.2.1  Introduction
       Care and treatment services for people living with HIV and AIDS include provision of ARVs, and other
       clinical services for the management of opportunistic infections. Wide access to ARVs was initiated in the
       country in October 2004 as part of the National care and treatment plan (2003-2008). The National care and
       treatment plan targeted to enrol 440,000 patients on ART by end five years of implementation. During the first
       year for implementation the target was to provide ARV to 44,000 patients. The targets were further increased
       to provide ART services to 100,000 by end  of 2006.  In terms of facility coverage the number increased from
       96 to 200 by December 2007. These facilities included all referral regional and district hospitals as well as
       some private and Faith Based hospitals. All the same home based care is a imperative    service in mitigating
       the physical, mental, spiritual, and socio-economic  difficulties   experienced by PLHIV  and their  families,
       completing the bridge in the continuum of care for the health services to the community. HSS target for 2003 ­
       2006 was to provide services to 5,000 PLHIV by 2005, conversely by the end of 2006 PLHIV reached with
       HBC services were 50,000 and the services had been established in 70 districts (53%) in Tanzania mainland.

       The major challenge has been the capacity to reach the primary health facilities so as to increase access of
       services to rural communities. Other challenges include widespread stigma and discrimination and ability to
       sustain quality services.

       This section addresses provision of care, treatment and support services across a continuum of care at health
       facility and community levels.

2.2.2        Intervention Area 1:     Facility Based Services

2.2.3  Preamble
       The plan focuses on scaling up activities, strengthening adherence to ART, integrating various HIV and AIDS
       programs with other health programs, and linking facility based interventions to community and home based
       care services. The strategy has taken into consideration the fact that there is low enrolment of children and
       males, and has designed activities aiming at increasing enrolment of these populations, including early infants
       diagnosis and follow up of children exposed to HIV.

2.2.4  Situational Analysis

2.2.4.1 Achievements
            A Five Year National Care and Treatment Plan (2003-2008) was prepared and implemented.
            A phased roll out of ART was implemented beginning with referral hospitals, followed by regional and
            district hospitals:, some private and Faith Based hospitals.
            By end of 2007, a total of 200 Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) were providing services.
            Facility assessment tool has been developed and is being used.
            Service standards and guidelines were developed and disseminated.
            Training curricula and materials were developed and used in training health workers.
            Infrastructure improvements, including purchase and installation of essential equipments and supplies
            were done.
            2,760 HCWs from various cadres were trained by December 2007.
            By 31st December 2007, a total of 262,717 patients were enrolled on care and 135,696 were initiated on
            ART.
            By March 2006, a total of 9 technical sub committees of the National Advisory Committee of the Care
            and Treatment were established. These include: Clinical care, PMTCT, Care and Support, Research, M
            &E, Training, Logistic, Laboratory and IEC sub committee,

                                                                                                               23
2.2.4.2  Challenges

          Aspects                     Challenges for Facility Based Services
          Availability                  The majority of rural population has limited access to ART.
                                        As of December 2007, only 32.4% and 8.24% of adult male and children
                                        respectively of the targeted number (150,000) of ART received this treatment
                                        Inadequate supply of OIs drugs and other essential supplies.
                                        Inadequate laboratory services
                                        Limited infrastructure for CTC services
                                        Limited number of days for offering ART services in some health facilities
          Acceptability                 Awareness of benefits of knowing ones HIV status and accessing care and
                                        treatment early is low.
                                        Public literacy on ART is low.
                                        Some    of the health  care providers are  not proficient in using criteria for
                                        initiating ART.
          Quality of services           Lack of integration of CTC clinics into routine care.
                                        Poor linkage of vertical programmes leading to inefficiency and at times
                                        artificial shortages of drugs and other commodities which PLHIV cannot
                                        access, e.g. Isoniazid from the TB program is not accessible to the Care and
                                        Treatment program, while cotrimoxazole is not accessed by TB patients in
                                        districts which have no TB/HIV integration activities.
                                        Poor absorptive capacity of VCT centres to scale up TB activities.
                                        Inadequate human resource capacity in terms of quantity and skills.
                                        Burn out among HCW is common and the rate of attrition is high.
                                        Low capacity at National and Regional level to monitor and supervise ART
                                        care and treatment interventions.
                                        Low involvement of PLHIV in the design and implementation of care and
                                        treatment plans.

2.2.4.3 Emerging Issue
            The demand for care and treatment services is still low thus there is need to introduce other approaches
            for HIV Counselling and Testing including Provider Initiated Testing and Counseling (PITC).
            Limited  nutritional  counseling   and   linkages with  sources of    food and   nutrients to  complement
            antiretroviral therapy.
            Disjointed CTC and HBC services in most districts.
            Other interventions apart from care and treatment(PMTCT, TB, STI, RCH) are delivered in vertical
            manner thus   leading to poor coordination and missed cross-referrals.
            More involvement of traditional healers in care and treatment.

2.2.5    Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
            Low enrolment of children and males into care.
            By and large the Care and Treatment programme is resource intensive and the government is consistently
            increasing its share over external support. e.g. 28% of ARV procurement has been contributed by the
            Government of Tanzania from 2004 to October 2007.

2.2.6    Strategic Objective - 1
         To strengthen and scale up implementation of comprehensive care and treatment services in public and
         private facilities so as to provide ART services to 90% of all PLHIV in need of ART of which 18% will be

2.2.3    Intervention Area 2:   Community Based Care Services

2.2.3.1  Preamble
         The number of patients with HIV and AIDS related diseases continues to increase steadily. Between 50% -
         60% of adult patients admitted in medical wards are believed to be due to HIV related causes. This places a
         significant burden on health professionals caring for the terminally ill. It is becoming difficult to give quality
         care in many of the already overburdened public health care facilities. In addition, results from studies done
         among patients with advanced HIV disease showed that many preferred to be nursed at home.

         The introduction  of ART  services  in  Tanzania has been challenged    to establish effective linkages with
         successful home based care programmes in order to increase patient identification, support adherence to
         treatment and follow-up.

2.2.3.2  Situational Analysis
         HSS target for 2003 ­ 2006 was to provide services to 5,000 patients by 2005 through:
         1.  Establishment of comprehensive HBC services in selected districts ,
         2.  Establishment and implementation of M & E system.

2.2.3.2.1 Achievements
             Guidelines for home based care services (2005) including training manuals (2005) have been developed
             to ensure the provision of quality of care across the continuum.
             The numbers of CSOs, NGOs and FBOs offering HBC services has increased significantly.
             HBC services were initiated in 70 districts (53%) and 50,000 PLHIV were reported to be receiving
             services by 2006.
             District home based care trainers, facility and community based home based care providers have been
             trained using the National curricula.

2.2.3.2.2 Challenges

          Aspects              Challenges for Community Based Services
          Availability            50,000 patients were receiving HBC services out of 320,000 who are in need by the
                                  end of 2006.
                                  As of December 2006, 70 districts (out of 124) had trained district HBC
                                  coordinators, HBC facility focal persons and community HBC providers using the
                                  national curriculum.   However, establishment of HBC services in these districts are
                                  partial.
                                  Irregular supply of HBC kits.
                                  Home     based care is mainly implemented    as projects not included  adequately in
                                  Comprehensive Council Health Plans (CCHP)
          Equitable access        Uncoordinated     and  non-standardized  provision   of  HBC   services   leading  to
                                  duplication of efforts and inefficient use of the meagre resources.

          Quality                 Poor coordination and poor referral systems and networking among key HBC
                                  implementers at all levels
                                  Inadequate capacity to coordinate and supervise HBC activities at all levels
                                  Inadequate provision of comprehensive care inclusive of medical/nursing,
                                  psychosocial, socio-economic, nutritional and legal/human rights needs.
                                  Inadequate involvement of PLHIV
                                  Inadequate community participation and involvement.
                                  Low motivation and non standardized incentive packages to the care providers.
                                  Low adherence to national home based care guidelines and standards.
                                  No standardized monitoring, evaluation and reporting systems and tools.

2.2.3.2.3 Emerging Issues
             Missed opportunities for HIV prevention in general and "prevention with positives" in particular.
             Lack of policy for pain management using oral morphine particularly in home based care.

                                                                                                                  26

2.3.         THEMATIC AREA III: CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES

2.3.1.   Introduction
         The National Multi-Sectoral Strategic Framework on HIV AND AIDS 2008-2012, lists cross cutting issues
         including the enabling  environment  and gives   a set of strategic    objectives and core strategies for each
         objective. The areas are mentioned as follows:
             Laboratory services,
             Counselling and testing,
             IEC, BCC and fighting stigma, and
             Condom promotion.

         These areas are cross-cutting and have a bearing on each of the activities in prevention, treatment, care and
         support thematic areas.

2.3.2    Intervention Area 1: Laboratory Services

2.3.3    Preamble
         Laboratory is one of the important components in HIV and AIDS interventions. It supports prevention, care
         and treatment services as well as monitoring the epidemic and drug susceptibility activities. In order to
         support the comprehensive HIV and AIDS interventions, it is important to have good quality and equitable
         laboratory services.

2.3.4    Situation Analysis
         The following achievements and challenges were encountered during the implementation of HSS on HIV
         and AIDS 2003-2006:

2.3.4.1  Achievements
         The following trainings have been conducted;
             A total of 287 laboratory staff from public and private hospitals were trained to test for HIV, CD4,
             haematology and chemistry.
             In addition, 842 health workers (laboratory and non laboratory) were trained on HIV rapid testing.
             A total of 30 laboratories (zonal, regional and district) were renovated.

             The following laboratory equipments were procured and installed;
             76 CD4 machines, 133 haematology analyzers and 113 chemistry analyzers. These equipments were
             installed in all referral, regional and some district hospitals.
             DNA PCR machine for HIV infant diagnosis was installed at Bugando Medical Centre;
             Laboratory Quality Assurance (QA) Guidelines was developed and disseminated.
             QA and training laboratory was constructed.
             Also    External  Quality Assurance  (EQA)     system for CD4       was initiated and  implemented    in all
             laboratories performing the test
             Algorithm for Rapid HIV Testing was revised and the updated one was rolled out.
             Distribution mechanism for STI, HIV and AIDS laboratory reagents and supplies was established.
             The Parliament passed the Laboratory Practitioners Act (2007) which allows rapid testing by non-
             laboratory health workers.
             A model of transporting laboratory samples (sample transportation system) is in pilot phase. Lessons
             learnt will be used to scale up the system in the rest of the country.
             Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for testing and equipments used were developed and rolled out.
             Laboratory information systems (laboratory forms and registers) for data recording and reporting were
             developed and in use,

                                                                                                                      28

          Aspects                Challenges for Laboratory Services
          Availability                There is no high containment laboratory (P3) in the country for virus isolation
                                      and characterization.
                                      Lack of capacity for HIV drug resistance testing
                                      There is inadequate supply for test kits ,laboratory reagents and other
                                      consumables to support HIV and syphilis testing services in various
                                      interventions
                                      Use of laboratory reagents and other consumables in activities not intended  for
                                      Increase in demand for some HIV laboratory   reagents
          Equitable access            There is shortage of CD4 equipment, haematology and chemistry analyzers and
                                      HIV infant diagnosis equipment.
                                      Shortage of qualified laboratory personnel
                                      Most laboratory services are based in urban areas.
                                      Weak logistic system leads to stock out and expiry of stocks sometimes.
          Quality                     There is inadequate monitoring of use of testing kits and laboratory supplies.
                                      There are inadequate cold storage facilities for test kits and reagents especially in
                                      the remote areas
                                      Slow implementation of the National guidelines for laboratory quality assurance
                                      system.
                                      Irregular maintenance and repair of laboratory equipment
                                      Poor laboratory infrastructure
                                      No laboratory accreditation system.
                                      Laboratory personnel do not have Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) training
                                      Inadequate quality control to most of the laboratories
                                      Non adherence to the national testing algorithm

2.3.5    Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
             Most of the good quality laboratory services are in urban areas.
             Limited capacity for early infant HIV diagnosis and CD4 % monitoring.
             Laboratory upgrading is expensive and the government should increase its funding in this area in order
             to ensure sustainability

2.3.6    Strategic Objective
         Strengthen laboratory system at all levels to support prevention, care, treatment and other interventions for
         STI, HIV and AIDS.
         Strategies
         1.  Ensure availability of appropriate laboratory infrastructure and equipment in health facilities including
             infant diagnosis
         2.  Strengthen  logistic  system to   ensure  uninterrupted  supply  of reagents    in all  health facilities for

 2.3.3      Intervention Area 2:    HIV Testing and Counselling (HTC) Services

2.3.3.1  Preamble
         The National Guidelines for Voluntary Counselling and Testing (2005) clearly state that HTC provides an
         opportunity to access accurate and comprehensive information on HIV, AIDS and STIs. It serves as an entry
         point to prevention, care, treatment and support, programmes and enables people to                  understand their HIV
         status and learn about supportive behaviours for protecting and preventing further spread of HIV.

         It has been noted that the demand for counselling and testing is high creating the need to introduce new
         approaches     for HIV  Testing     and Counselling      (HTC)    to     complement     the client   initiated Voluntary
         Counselling and Testing (VCT). These new approaches include Provider Initiated Testing and Counselling
         (PITC) and Home Based Counselling and Testing a (HBCT). Further more; the existing public, private and
         voluntary agencies services are available in only a small proportion of health facilities and cannot handle the
         high demand for this service. The establishment of stand alone VCT sites has been slow and unsatisfactory.
         Therefore, there is need to expand the existing systems in order to address this situation,

2.3.3.2  Situation Analysis
         The target for the 2003-2006 HSS was to train 1,600 counsellors countrywide and establish six               VCT sites in
         each district.

         Below are the achievements and challenges in implementing HTC services during the past HSS 2003-2006:

2.3.3.2.1 Achievements
             Trainings have been conducted as follows;
             -    2,739 counsellors, 96 national VCT trainers and 62 regional and district VCT supervisors had been
                  trained.
             -    Sixty members of CHMT were oriented on managerial skills on the supervision of VCT and other
                  HIV and AIDS-related interventions.
             Training Curriculum for counsellors was reviewed.
             National guidelines   for VCT (2005) was developed
             1,035 VCT sites were established by 2006.

2.3.3.2.2 Challenges
          Aspects             Challenges for HIV Testing and Counseling
          Availability           Irregular supply of HIV test kits at all levels.
                                 33% of the districts have less than 6 VCT sites.
                                 VCT services being partially included in the Council Comprehensive Health Plan
                                 Lack of recognition of counselling as a career path (counsellors is not a cadre in the health
                                 system).
          Equitable              Only 15% of people aged 15 to 49 have been tested and know their status.
          access                 The available number of trained counsellors does not match with     the existing demand.
                                 Groups with special needs are     marginalised due to lack of skills to provide counselling to
                                 special groups, for example, auditory and visually impaired individuals, children and MARPs
                                 Inequitable distribution of VCT sites across     the country
                                 Most of the VCT services were not youth friendly
          Acceptability          Fear and stigma prevent uptake of VCT services
                                 VCT services are mostly health facility based and provided on     part time

2.3.3.2.3Emerging Issues
               Private for profit partners find it uneconomical to conduct VCT-related activities due to various factors
               including
             -   They are required to provide free HIV testing
             -   Transporting samples for quality control   without reimbursement   of costs involved.
             -   Perceived as additional work without remuneration
               Existence of discordance among couples

2.3.3.3  Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
               Low coverage in   rural areas and among vulnerable populations.
               More women than men are accessing     HTC services in the health facilities.

         Change Communication (BCC)

2.3.4.1  Preamble
         Behaviour  change  communication    (BCC)    is  a process  by which  information   and   skills are shared  and
         disseminated  to  people  in the specific target   audience with the intention  of influencing    them  to adopt
         sustained changes in behaviour or attitude. Behaviour change as a process, involves knowledge and attitudes,

                                                                                                                      31
          a favourable social, cultural and physical environment for the expected change to take place. The processes
          behind what happens are summarised on the Figure 5 below.

2.3.4.2   Situation Analysis
          In the previous          health          sector strategy        2003-2006,  the terms         IEC                 and           BCC  were   integrated                 as "Health
          Promotion" on the understanding that health promotion is a cross-cutting issue. In this health sector strategy
          the components were separated to give more emphasis on BCC interventions.
          Below are the achievements and challenges gathered from various behavioural surveys conducted during the
          period 2003-2006:

2.3.4.2.1  Achievements
                 Age at first sexual intercourse among female and male adolescent has risen slightly from 16.7 in 1999
                 to 17 years in 2004 -2005. (DHS 2004-05)
                 15% of Tanzanians aged 15-49 years have ever been tested                                                 for HIV. (THIS         2003-2004)

2.3.4.2.2 Challenges
           Aspects                          Challenges with BCC Programming
           Availability                            No Health sector        specific communication strategy
                                                   Inadequate  BCC programming in HIV and AIDS interventions
                                                   Public awareness         on some   of  the core                        interventions        still low  and              many     myths  and
                                                   misconceptions persist
                                                   Inadequate human resource in BCC programming at all levels
                                                   Insufficient dissemination of data on behaviors that influence HIV epidemic
           Equitable access                        Inadequate messages in rural        areas
                                                   Messages   are       not focused   to MARPs            and                 people        with disabilities              eg.    auditory and
                                                   visually  impaired people
           Quality                                 IEC has often resulted in the production of discrete communication materials.
                                                   Lack   of quality        assurance and   quality                       control          system    for effectiveness                of BCC

                                                   Current messages are not contextualised to various cultural                                       settings

                                                                                                                                                                                         32
2.3.4.3   Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations:
          The difference in prevalence between males and females in the country calls for the proper understanding of
          gender dynamics in order to address the situation in a comprehensive manner.

2.3.4.4   Strategic Objective
          Improve provision of BCC interventions for HIV and AIDS using the contextual approach
          Strategies
          1.  Establish  a   profile of   information on  knowledge,  Attitude   and  behavioural  practices of various
              communities in Tanzania.
          2.  Ensure    the formulation    of the health sector specific  HIV  and AIDS    Communication Strategy to
              support implementation of the HSHSP II
          3.  Strengthen the linkages with key stakeholders of BCC from both public and private sectors.

2.3.4.5   Targets
          1.  Four   focused   KAP    studies conducted by 2010 to address key knowledge gaps on the determinant of
              the epidemics in Tanzania
          2.  Health sector HIV and AIDS Communication Strategy developed by 2009
          3.  Mechanisms to link various BCC stakeholders established by 2010

2.3.4.6   Indicators
              Number of KAP studies conducted
              Health sector HIV and AIDS Communication Strategy in place.

 2.3.5        Intervention Area 3b: IEC, BCC programming and Stigma Reduction Interventions:
              Information, Education and Communication (IEC)

2.3.5.1   Preamble
          Information Education and Communication is a process that informs, motivates and helps people to adopt
          and maintain healthy practices and life skills. It aims at empowering individuals and enabling them to make
          correct decisions  about   safe behaviour practices.  IEC  also attempts to create an environment    which is
          conducive to support access to treatment and services to those already infected.

2.3.5.2   Situation analysis
          Below are the achievements and challenges in implementing IEC in HSS 2003-2006:

2.3.5.2.1          Achievements
             Awareness of HIV and AIDS in Tanzania is 99% among age group 15- 49 (THIS 2004)
             Print materials: 280,000 wall calendars, 1,351,000 brochures, 200,000 booklets, 394,000 posters and
             535,000 newsletters.
             Audio visual: TV and radio programs (film, spots & live talk shows).
             Various  IEC materials produced by local NGOs.
             NACP website developed and key documents posted

2.3.5.2.2          Challenges
           Aspects          Challenges in IEC materials production
           Availability        No evaluation done on impact of different types of media used for channelling messages
                               to the public
                               Website not yet comprehensive.
                               Insufficient   IEC materials
                               Cumbersome      procurement process and poor distribution system
           Equitable           Centralized and inadequate production of IEC materials.
           access              Local   media and other communication channels are rarely used
                               Messages    are not  focused to  MARPs     and people  with special needs  eg.  Auditory,
                               visually   impaired people and elders
           Quality             Lack of coordination mechanism of production of IEC materials
                               Current messages are not contextualised to local settings

                                                                                                                     33
2.3.5.3  Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations:
             Access to information is limited to certain geographical settings, age and social groups,
             Some of the IEC materials are not sensitive to gender, economic dimensions political-legal         context
             which influence sexual relations

2.3.5.4  Strategic Objective
         Improve the provision of HIV and AIDS information through innovative approaches based on available
         evidence.

         Strategies
         1.  Produce IEC materials targeting different age and social groups
         2.  Ensure  availability of  print and   electronic IEC materials   for universal access to prevention, care,
             treatment and support at all levels.
         3.  Strengthen collaborative IEC activities/ interventions with different partners.
         4.  Strengthen NACP library
         5.  Strengthen distribution of IEC materials especially to rural areas.

2.3.5.5  Targets
         1.  IEC materials for universal access to prevention, Care, treatment and support are available in rural areas
         2.  Coordinate production of major IEC materials.
         3.  NACP website fully developed by 2010
         4.  NACP library strengthened

2.3.5.6  Indicators
         1.  % of produced    IEC materials for universal access available in rural areas
         2.  % of IEC materials produced under coordination
         3.   Number of NACP library users.

2.3.5.7  Key implementers
         MOHSW,     PMORALG,      TACAIDS,    Public  and    Private Sector partners, Tanzania library services board,
         CSOs.

2.3.6   Intervention  Area    3c: IEC,  BCC      programming     and    Stigma   Reduction   Interventions: Stigma  and
         Discrimination

2.3.6.1  Preamble
         Stigma is a mark of shame or discredit on a person or a group of people. Stigma can manifest itself in a
         variety of ways, from ignoring the needs of a person or group to psychologically or physically harming those
         who are stigmatized.

         Stigma causes discrimination which in turn leads to human rights violations for PLHIV and their families.
         Stigma and discrimination fuel HIV and AIDS epidemic because they hamper prevention and care efforts by
         sustaining silence and denial about HIV and AIDS. Also they contribute in the marginalization of PLHIV
         and those who are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection like men who have sex with men (MSM), sex
         workers (SWs), survivors of rape, Injecting Drug Users (IDUs), migrant populations and others.

         The importance of addressing stigma in the context of BCC campaigns has programmatic implications that
         go beyond  compassion    and humane     treatment.  Failure to address  stigma jeopardizes BCC  programs  in
         prevention, quality of care and policy.

2.3.6.2  Situation analysis
         Below are achievements and challenges encountered when implementing 2003-2006 plans:-

2.3.6.2.1 Achievements
            Training materials on stigma and discrimination for health workers developed

          Aspects                Challenges in Stigma Reduction among HCW
          Availability              Minimal stigma reduction activities in health care setting.
                                    Health workers lack skills to educate people on stigma and discrimination
                                    There is no clear law to minimize stigma and promote respect for PLHIV
          Equitable access          Limited coverage of   training for health care workers on issues related to stigma
                                    and discrimination
                                    Lack of stigma reduction services to MARPs and marginalised people.
          Quality                   Stigma reduction activities not coordinated.

2.3.6.3  Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
         Women    and  the poor PLHIV  are  more stigmatized.    Stigma depletes   meager resources due    to shopping
         around for care from different providers. PLHIV are frequently subjected to poor quality of health care.

2.3.6.4  Strategic Objective
         Ensure stigma reduction interventions at all levels of health system..

         Strategies
         1.  Promote development   and integration of stigma reduction interventions at all levels of health system.
         2.  Strengthen coordination mechanism on    stigma and discrimination reduction activities at all levels

2.3.6.5  Targets
         1.  Stigma reduction interventions developed,   integrated and implemented at all levels of health system by
             2012.
         2.  Incorporate stigma and discrimination reduction modules in various health training materials by 2012.

2.3.6.6  Indicators
         1.  % of districts with Stigma and discrimination reduction plans.
         2.  Number of health care facilities implementing stigma reduction activities.
         3.  Number of interventions  training materials containing stigma and discrimination   modules.

2.3.7    Intervention Area 4: Condom Promotion and Use

2.3.7.1  Preamble
         Promotion of female and male condoms and their proper use are recognised to be an important aspect for
         prevention of sexual transmission of HIV and STIs/RTIs. Despite the concerted efforts towards condom
         promotion,  their wider acceptance and  use  is still a challenge. Myths    and misconceptions    surrounding
         condom use still exists. There is a strong need to continue with rigorous efforts and/or campaigns including
         social marketing in order to minimize barriers towards condom use.

2.3.7.2  Situation analysis
         Below are achievements and challenges encountered when implementing 2003-2006 plans

2.3.7.2.1 Achievements
             41.7% of youth aged 15-24 years used condoms at their last higher risk sex (THIS 2003/04).
             Total number of male and female condoms procured by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in
             2006 was 85 million and   0.75 million respectively.
             Increased partnership with NGOs in condom promotion

                                                                                                                   35
2.3.7.2.2 Challenges

          Aspects              Challenges in Condom Distribution
          Availability             Condom outlets are limited in number and variety
                                   Youth friendly  outlets are limited
                                   While the cost of condoms is comparatively small in the social marketing, it is not
                                   affordable by  certain segments of the population.
                                   Female condoms are not widely available.
                                   Inadequate number    of penile and pelvic models for demonstration
          Equitable access         74%    (68% F, 83% M) of urban youth know of a condom outlet but only      55% (44%
                                   F, 67% M) of rural youth do (THIS, 2004)
                                   Distribution through health facilities was a hindrance to people needing them from
                                   alternative source.
                                   Condom availability in rural areas is erratic
                                   Inadequate condoms for vulnerable groups
          Awareness                In health facilities, condom use is usually   promoted for family planning and for STI
                                   patients
          Acceptability            65% (61% F, 69% M) of 18 to 49 year old people think that children aged 12 to 14
                                   should be taught about condoms (THIS, 2003/04)
                                   Female condoms not widely acceptable
          Affordability            54.2 %of male condoms are free, 45.8% are sold through social marketing (2006
                                   NACP) @ TZS. 100 for a pack of 3.
                                   Female condoms are relatively expensive @ TZS. 1000 each (PSI)

2.3.7.3  Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
         Accessibility of female condoms is a challenge. Similarly, the distribution of free male and female condoms
         through health facilities limits access to people who are not sick.

2.3.7.4  Strategic Objective
         Strengthen promotion, availability, accessibility and use of condoms

         Strategies
         1.  Establish private-public partnership to create alternative condom distribution outlets
         2.  Establish private-public partnership to promote use of condom using different innovative approaches
         3.  Provide   comprehensive information and education to health care workers
         4.  Strengthen condom programming      and monitoring systems
         5.  Support operational research on condoms

2.3.7.5  Targets
         1.  At least 60% of youth aged 15-24 years use condoms in all       risk sexual exposure
         2.  Condom use promoted using ten    different innovative approaches through private- public partnership at
             all levels by 2012
         3.  Develop training materials on dual protection of condoms for HIV and STIs prevention and family
             planning
         4.  Identify five additional partners for condom distribution by 2012
         5.  Conduct four operational research on condom promotion and distribution by 2010

2.4.    THEMATIC AREA IV: HEALTH SYSTEM STRENGTHENING

2.4.1.   Introduction
         Successful scale-up and utilisation of a broad range of HIV and AIDS services and products requires a well
         functioning health system. The system should be able to respond, not only to current, but also to future
         emerging and re-emerging HIV and AIDS issues

         In order for the system to produce the expected outcomes, it is necessary to have a mechanism that will
         ensure that appropriate inputs and processes are in place and are based on a strong foundation. Conceptually,
         as can be seen from Table 8, the system is expected to have a strong leadership base, strong programme
         management system, adequate human resource mix, efficient procurement and supply system. In addition, it
         requires strategic information and a good financial base to sustain it.

     It is recognised that health systems constraints are the root    cause of the poor outcomes of health interventions.        It
     is therefore, necessary to examine the health system and find out whether it is able to provide answers to the
     following questions:
         Is it possible and what constraints need to be overcome to make HIV and AIDS interventions in the health
         sector available to the large numbers of people in need- i.e. are we delivering good services and ensuring
         healthy outcomes in a fair manner for the whole health sector?
         How will the equity principle be maintained in the inevitably incremental process of scale up or roll-out- i.e.
         is it possible to leverage the additional HIV and AIDS resources to address existing health challenges and
         improve the overall health care delivery?
         Is it feasible to structure the investments in HIV and AIDS interventions so that they do not divert scarce
         resources away from other essential activities and instead benefit the health system for delivery of all health
         programmes-    i.e  when  introducing      HIV   and    AIDS  interventions,     are    we  safeguarding     the existing
         programmes from further deterioration- stewardship, leadership role?

         The major health system constraints in general can be grouped into 2 parts:
         Demand side where there is lack of universal access to a service delivery infrastructure. Examples of demand
         side barriers are. affordability, distance and governance to accessing services, inadequate service delivery
         infrastructure, weak drug regulatory and supply systems and multiple donor interests which might not be in
         tandem with national interests.

                                                                                                                             37
         The supply side of the constraint are human resources, inadequate infrastructure, organization of the health
         facilities and the way the service  delivery  is traditionally organized.
         However, the constraints of the two parts are not mutually exclusive.
         Strengthening health systems as part of HIV and AIDS scale up plan should ensure that
         Wider benefits of the general health system are achieved by making possible the integration of HIV and
         AIDS intervention into existing health systems and
         Specific scale up or expansion of HIV and AIDS programmes are realized through building the necessary
         new infrastructure.

         The entry points for the integration of STI, HIV and AIDS interventions can be at the point of service
         delivery, in  the  management    of programmes     at district or local level, in  the financing,  procurement  of
         resources and in the monitoring of programmes at national level.

         Therefore the two aspects of health system strengthening in terms of ensuring wider benefits while scaling up
         STI, HIV and AIDS programmes will be addressed in this thematic section.

2.4.2    Intervention Area 1: National Strategic Planning and Programme Management

2.4.2.1  Preamble
         As indicated   in  the   introduction, HIV  and   AIDS    epidemics  have   increased  the burden  in  the already
         overstretched health care delivery system. This calls for innovative and renewed thinking on health systems
         and service delivery as well as infrastructure, human resources development and planning.

         This section explores how strengthening health service delivery at all levels would be done through:
              Innovative and renewed thinking on the organization of the health services
              Joint program management in:
                -  Planning, implementation and reporting of activities,
                -  quality improvement and standard setting
                -  resource mobilization, utilization and accountabilities
              Providing technical support to non health sectors and development partners
              Options for delivering HIV interventions at community and household levels through partnerships and
              involvement of community-based organizations and PLHIV.

2.4.2.2  Situation analysis
         Below    are the achievements   and    challenges of  the general health   sector reform  and  the introduction of
         specific HIV and AIDS scaling up programmes.

2.4.2.2.1 Achievements
         General health sector reform-Programme management:
              At national level the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has initiated a process for improving
              the following:
              -    Decentralization of services and the strengthening of existing institutions and other management
                   structures.
              -    Harmonization    of  policies, guidelines  and  development   of  strategic  plans for human   resources
                   development and capacity-building;
              -    Harmonization of management of major commodities (i.e. ITNs, antimalarial medicines, ARVs, OI,
                   STI medicines, diagnostics) at all levels;
              -    Ensuring drug quality including establishing pharmacovigilance activities
              -    Strengthening strategic information management and health information systems
              -    A process for harmonisation and clarification of roles and responsibilities between the MOHSW and
                   Local  government    health  institutions. Within  the  framework    of the  ongoing   local government
                   reforms, the local government authorities have responsibilities for delivering health services. The
                   responsibilities for MoHSW      are technical   guidance; policy  formulation;   supportive  supervision,
                   capacity  building,  coordination,  setting standards   and evaluation   of  health services  within  the
                   councils.
         At regional, district and facility levels
            -      RHMTs perform roles similar to those     of national level to provide technical support to   CHMTs
            -      There are autonomous Council Health Boards under the respective local government authorities.
            -      Existence   of most  accessible  primary   health care  services which  include  reproductive  and child
                   health services, STI, TB and other communicable diseases.
            -      Existence of   services that are linked with, households and communities:

                                                                                                                         38
           -     Reproductive and child health services, serve as pivotal entry point for the delivery of interventions
                 for the prevention of HIV in pregnant women, their partners and children. Other services include:
                 IMCI, TB DOTS, Care and Treatment for PLHIV and control of communicable diseases.

             Planning, financing and quality improvement at all levels
             -   Strategic plans exist
             -   Resource mobilization is done including funding for STI, HIV and AIDS and major communicable
                 and non communicable diseases at all levels
             -   Documents on modalities of channelling funds are available
             -   Quality improvement framework is available.
         Programme management for specific STI, HIV and AIDS interventions
             At national level
         Direct management and planning for the Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategy is the responsibility of
         National AIDS Control Programme (NACP).        To date the NACP has:
           -     Developed and harmonized HIV related guidelines
           -     Strengthened the capacity of different cadres of health care workers.
           -     Facilitated and provided technical assistance to other stakeholders at all levels.
           -     Established linkages with other departments of the MoHSW, other government sectors, agencies,
                 NGOs, development partners, academic institutions, CSOs and community resources.
           -     Strengthened the capacity of Regional Health Management Teams to supervise, monitor, and assist
                 the CHMTs in planning and implementing interventions.
           -     Fostered partnerships and collaboration among relevant programmes or interventions which are a
                 prerequisite for joint planning and implementation of effective integrated services.
           -     Developed a National plan for care and treatment and started gradual initiation of ART beginning
                 with referral and regional hospitals followed by district hospitals.
           -     Developed resource centre for HIV AND AIDS including the website
           -     Developed a large variety of IEC materials (electronic and printed).
           -     Coordination of research activities on HIV and AIDS
             Conducted supportive supervision to RHMTs and CHMTs.
             Promoted scaling up of HIV and AIDS interventions including:
             Coordination of all partners involved in Care and Treatment Plan  (Regionalization)
             Harmonization of management of the major commodities (i.e. ARVs, diagnostics) at all levels; and
             Strengthening management of strategic information (surveillance and M&E).

2.4.2.2.2Challenges Specific to the General Health Sector Strategy

         Aspect              Challenges for general health system strengthening
         Availability          Inadequate internal mainstreaming of HIV and AIDS into MoHSW departments at
                               all levels.
                               Difficulties in identifying HIV and AIDS as a priority despite prioritization
                               guidelines particularly at local government authority.
                               Inadequate budget for HIV and AIDS interventions as part of MTEF at all levels.
         Equitable access      At district level financial resources are insufficient for routine operations
                               Budget allocations for HIV and AIDS at Councils levels are not sufficient to trickle
                               down to village levels..
         Quality               Limited capacity to appropriately operationalize national guidelines and standards

                                                                                                                    39
2.4.2.2.3 Challenges Specific to scaling up of HIV and AIDS interventions

          Aspect             Challenges for specific HIV and AIDS scale up
          Availability          Limited HIV and AIDS services in rural areas and for vulnerable populations
                                Lack of infrastructure to accommodate the increasing number of patients
                                Weak logistic system for distribution of commodities particularly to the lower
                                level of the health system.
          Equitable access      Availability of human resource in hard to reach areas is a bottleneck for quality
                                services
                                Poor  logistic for commodities  create shortages in remote areas while supply at
                                central level are abundant
          Quality               No   functional feedback loop on quality improvement issues

                                Inadequate supportive supervision.

2.4.2.3  Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
            Comprehensive    HIV  and AIDS  interventions     should contribute to  strengthening health systems  and
            capacity for equitable service delivery, to address the needs of poorer communities and those most at risk.
            Delivery of comprehensive HIV interventions within a strong existing social, health and a functioning
            referral system in a coherent manner may permit effective implementation and widespread utilization of
            human resources and address serious resource constraints.

2.4.2.4  Strategic Objective
         Strengthen managerial capacity for planning, resource allocation, utilization, implementation and monitoring
         of all, HIV and AIDS interventions at all levels.

         Strategies
         1. Ensure capacity improvement for planning , resource allocation and implementation of HIV and AIDS
            programs.
         2. Strengthen coordination of HIV and AIDS interventions at all levels

         3. Strengthen and implement system of quality improvement of HIV and AIDS interventions.

2.4.2.5  Targets
         1. Improve management capacity for planning, resource allocation and coordination         in 20% of district
            levels  by 2012.

2.4.3   Intervention area 2: Procurement and supply management Systems for STI, HIV and AIDS medicines,
         health commodities, laboratory reagents and supplies

2.4.3.1  Preamble
         Procurement,  supply and  management  of medicines,     health commodities   and reagents  are  an important
         element  for the HIV  and AIDS   responses.   The   Medical   Stores Department  was established   to offer a
         centralized procurement, storage and distribution system for all health commodities. The MSD is the main
         stockists and distributor of all medicines and laboratory supplies. Due to emerging demands of major public
         health diseases including HIV and AIDS, the ability of MSD coping with the demands is constrained.

         Most HIV and AIDS medicines have been developed in the recent years and hence their long term safety in
         large populations have  not been well established.    For that reason,  Tanzania Food    and Drug  Authority
         (TFDA) has in place a pharmacovigilance system for all medicines whereby health workers report adverse
         drug reactions occurring in their places of work.

                                                                                                                   40
         Pharmacovigilance is a terminology used to indicate the process of detection, assessment, understanding and
         prevention of adverse effects, particularly long term and short term side effect of medicines.  The long term
         and short  term side   effects are termed Adverse  Drug     Reactions (ADR)     on patients that are using   a
         pharmaceutical product.

2.4.3.2  Situation Analysis

2.4.3.2.1 Achievements
         Based on the general health sector reforms.
            Procurement and supply management Systems for STI, HIV and AIDS medicines, health commodities
            and laboratory reagents and supplies is established
            Presence of infrastructure for procurement, storage, supply and distribution
            Established  computerized   inventory system  covering   the medical  store  departments (headquarter   and
            zones)
            Indent and Integrated Logistics Management (ILS) system for ordering all the major supplies is in place.
            The system of allocating funds at MSD for Health Facilities to draw supplies based on the allocated funds
            is working
            Mechanisms of selecting and reviewing medicines for the management of HIV and AIDS are in place
            through the National Essential Medicine List for Tanzania (NEMLIT).

         Medicines Registration and manufacturing.
            Existence of  mechanisms for fast tracking registration of    HIV and AIDS medicines (ARVs) through
            TFDA
            Local companies have started manufacturing some ARVs

         Pharmacovigilance and quality assurance
            Existence of a system for monitoring Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) for HIV and AIDS medicines.
            A system for monitoring the quality of medicines from the ports of entry as well as those circulating in
            the market exists in the country.

2.4.3.2.2 Challenges
         Procurement  and   supply  management    Systems for   HIV  and   AIDS   medicines,  diagnostic  supplies  and
         laboratory reagents
            Two competing systems (Push and Pull) for acquisition of supplies from the same source to the end users
            Erratic supplies especially of STI/RTI medicines, HIV diagnostics tests and laboratory commodities
            Inadequate capacity for forecasting and ordering    required commodities especially in rural areas and at
            primary health facilities.
            Inefficient fall back opportunities at facility level to use alternative methods of acquiring supplies when
            MSD has stock outs.
            Poor coordination and communication about available stocks and demands from end users

         Pharmacovigilance
            There is gross under reporting of ADR .
            Poor coordination   and dissemination of ADR information in both vertical and horizontal    directions.

2.4.3.3  Equity, Gender and sustainability considerations
         Rural areas have less commodities because of poor logistic system and storage capacity for the required
         supplies. Funding   of supplies  for HIV  and AIDS     is donor  dependent and   so  a local and  sustainable
         alternative funding sources need to be sought including private sector involvement.

2.4.3.4  Strategic objective
         To strengthen procurement, supply management and pharmacovigilance systems for STI, HIV and AIDS
         medicines, diagnostics and other commodities
         Strategies
        1.  Build capacity of Medical Stores Department for procurement, storage and supply management systems
            for HIV and AIDS medicines, diagnostics and other commodities
        2.  Regular revision of NEMLIT and availability of HIV and AIDS, STI and OIs related medicines.
        3.  Strengthen  the  National   Pharmacovigilance system     for tracking and   providing feedback    on ADR
            associated with HIV and AIDS, STI and OIs medication.

                                                                                                                    41
2.4.3.5  Targets

2.4.4    Intervention area 3: Human Resource

2.4.4.1  Preamble
         Implementation of the HS HIV and AIDS Strategy II (2008-2012) to a large extent will depend on the
         number and quality of health workers at all levels in the health system. Tanzania has serious human resource
         for health shortage reaching a crisis situation. The establishment requires 55,404 HCWs of different cadre
         while only 21, 248 HCW (15,403 public and 5,845 private) are in place. Therefore, the implementation of the
         countrys health policy relies on the available 38% of the required human resource.

2.4.4.2  Situation analysis
         Below are the achievements and challenges with regards to human resources

2.4.4.2.1 Achievements
         General health reform considerations
             Data   on human resource mix from various sources exist
             In-service and pre-service training of HCWs exists
             Staff have opportunities for career advancement.
             Task shifting activities initiated

         Specific HIV and AIDS human resource issues
             In-service trainings for some HIV and AIDS interventions
             Long term training for HIV and AIDS programming has been done in country and abroad
             Some informal task shifting practices have been initiated

2.4.4.2.2 Challenges
         The health sector has several human resource challenges.   These include:

         Planning and management
             Inadequate capacity in planning and management of required and available human resource.
             Inadequate  team building and leadership skills at all levels
             Limited reliable data on existing human resource
             Imbalances in the geographical distribution of available human resources.
             Lack of mechanisms for the management of the migration of human resource for health

         Training
             Lack of a master plan for training in the health sector.
             Inadequate facilities and equipments for training in all institutions including Universities in order to
             meet the increased demand for student enrolment.
             Inadequate quality assurance in training institutions.

         Retention schemes
             Lack of monetary and non-monetary incentives for workers
             Poor working environment

         Career development
             A large number of existing work-force needs upgrading.
             Lack of opportunities for continuing education for workers in hard to reach areas

                                                                                                             42
             No mechanism for mentoring newly qualified HCW especially in rural areas.
             Lack of career development scheme

         Specific HIV and AIDS human resource issues
             Multiple bodies responsible for recruitment and management of human resources for health.
              -     The tendency of recruitment of staff by projects and secondment practices
             Health workers training
              -     Different schedules of in-service training practices by various HIV and AIDS interventions or
                    programmes
             Task shifting policy.
              -     No standardized programme for training and certification that guarantees essential  standards of
                    care.
              -     No regulatory framework
              -     Unclear incentive package for implementing task shifting plan (policy).
             Under the reform process recruitment and placement of human resources is the responsibility of local
             authorities while technical supervision is under MoHSW. This creates dual allegiance for HCWs

2.4.4.3  Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
             There are imbalances in the distribution of available human resources between rural and urban areas by
             type of health facilities and interventions which need to be considered.
             Use of special salaries and other emoluments as a way of attracting and retaining staff in projects is not
             sustainable and worsens    the human resource crisis.
             There is need to develop a criteria for defining hard to reach areas and develop an incentive mechanism
             for motivating, deployment of HCW in those areas.

2.4.4.4  Strategic Objective
         Establish a system to build and sustain human resource.

         Strategies
         1.  Strengthen    the institution responsible for managing the response at national level (NACP secretariat)
             with the optimum number of human resource mix
         2.  Strengthen regions so that they have the human resource capacity for providing technical support to
             council at district levels
         3.  To contribute to human resource training master plan for the staff required for managing the HIV and
             AIDS responses

2.4.4.5  Targets
         1.  Functions and skills required for comprehensive HIV and AIDS responses at all levels established.
         2.  Human resource capacity required for managing the HIV and AIDS responses strengthened.

2.4.5.1  Preamble
         Tanzania AIDS commission (TACAIDS) is responsible for organisation and coordination of the         national
         HIV and    AIDS monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan. Drawing from the national multisectoral M&E, the
         Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, through its NACP, organises the health sector M&E plan.M&E unit
         of NACP is responsible for second generation surveillance and M&E of health sector interventions according
         to the health sector strategy for HIV/AIDS.

         In collaboration with partners and academic institutions the M&E unit is responsible for standardization of
         M&E of HIV and AIDS intervention through development of protocols, training materials, and supervision
         guides. It also develops, prints and distributes data collection tools to all facilities, train regional and district
         trainers. It also coordinates implementation, analysis of data to produce reports and disseminate to all levels.

                                                                                                                43
          In addition to the second generation surveillance. The unit is currently implementing M&E activities for HIV
          and AIDS chronic care, HTC, PMTCT and STI, and        M&E system for HBC is being established.
          Service data is collected and summarised at service provision points using standardised forms and it flows to
          the district, regional and national levels.At each level a summary is generated and disseminated.

2.4.5.2   Situation Analysis
          Below are the achievements and challenges with regards to M&E implementation during the past HSS for
          HIV and AIDS (2003-2006)

                                  Lack of linkage between M & E system for various interventions.
                                  Lack of information or documentation on best practices

2.4.5.2.3 Emerging Issues
          Relevancy of AIDS cases reporting in the era of HIV care and treatment

2.4.5.3   Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
          The M&E infrastructure is poor in rural areas. Vulnerability of data systems due to financial, security and
          technological reasons. Therefore there is need to strengthen M&E infrastructure at all levels of health care
          systems

2.4.6   Intervention area 4b: Strategic information: Behavioural and Biological Surveillance on STI, HIV and
          AIDS

2.4.6.1   Situation analysis
          In the transmission of HIV infection, both biological and behavioural factors play a significant role. Thus
          surveillance of HIV and AIDS needs to include both biological and behavioural aspects.

2.4.6.1.1 Achievements
              ANC    surveillance increased  from 10 regions in 2003 to 21 regions in 2006
              In collaboration with partners, Behavioural Surveillance Survey   (BSS) were conducted in five regions
              and results disseminated
              Comprehensive module of BSS is included in THIS and DHS
              One round of national HIV indicator survey was completed and disseminated.

2.4.6.1.2  Challenges

          Aspect                Challenges
          Availability             Inadequate capacity to intensify surveillance activities at district level.
                                   National  surveillance  results are  presented  in    scientific formats    not easily
                                   understandable by majority of targeted users.
                                   Results are not packaged according to target audiences
          Equitable access         No surveillance activities targeting the most-at-risk sub populations (MARPs)
                                   Results are not packaged according to target audiences
                                   Results from national surveys are not disaggregated by districts.
          Quality                  Use of RPR test in STI surveillance pauses difficulties in remote areas due to the
                                   cold chain requirement and cumbersome methodology
                                   False  positive RPR    results  due to interactions    with other   antigens    in the
                                   environment.

2.4.6.1.3  Emerging issue
              BSS among populations in the ANC catchment areas is no longer considered the right methodology.
              Emerging sources of prevalence data needs to be validated and become part     of surveillance systems.

2.4.6.2   Equity, Gender and sustainability considerations
          Need to supplement population based surveys with anthropological data from      hard to reach populations and
          by geographic areas.

2.4.6.3   Strategic Objective
          Strengthen surveillance activities to monitor the dynamics of the epidemic and the impact of STI, HIV and
          AIDS interventions.
          Strategies
          1.  Strengthen biological and behavioural surveillance systems for STI, HIV and AIDS
          2.  Establish surveillance activities for most at risk populations (MARPs).

2.4.7   Intervention area 4c: Strategic information: Surveillance of HIV, STIs and TB Drugs Resistance as well
         as Drug Adverse Effects

2.4.7.1  Situation Analysis
         While the HIV and AIDS interventions are scaled up, there is a risk of emergence of HIV drug resistance.
         This risk needs to be identified early so that appropriate measures are instituted.

         It must be borne in mind that before the start of the national HIV care and treatment programme already
         there were PLHIV on ARVs. These individuals had used ARVs without existence of national HIV and AIDS
         treatment guidelines. Therefore, there is a fear of having a pool of people with resistant organisms.

         There is also need to monitor STI and TB drug susceptibility patterns to inform policies on management of
         STIs and possible emergence of multi-drug resistant TB.

2.4.7.1.1 Achievements
            Country   adaptation of   internationally recommended   strategy    for early    identification of HIV  drug
            resistance
            Tanzania has initiated and implemented surveillance of transmitted HIV drug resistance in one region.
            Activities for HIV drug resistance monitoring have been initiated
            Availability of pharmacovigilance system for all pharmaceutical products
            TB drug resistance monitoring system is functional

2.4.7.1.2 Challenges

        Aspect               Challenges
        Availability             Activities for drug resistant monitoring are inadequate.
                                 Available capacity to carry out STI drug susceptibility monitoring is not utilized
        Equitable Access         Limited coverage of drug resistance and adverse drug monitoring in rural areas
        Quality                  Insufficient capacity to correctly identify and report on side effects of ARVs

2.4.7.2  Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
         Resources involved in conducting regular surveillance activities, in selected facilities is substantially funded
         by foreign donors.

2.4.7.3  Strategic objective
         Strengthen surveillance of ARVs and STI drug resistance as well as pharmacovigilance of ARVs, STI drugs
         and OI medication
         Strategies
         1.  Establish a system for monitoring STI drugs susceptibility
         2.  Implement HIV drug resistance strategy
         3.  Strengthen pharmacovigilance activities for ARVs, STI and OI medication

2.4.7.4  Targets

2.4.7     Intervention Area 5:    Priority HIV and AIDS and STI Research

2.4.7.1   Preamble
          Research  is essential in providing    evidence-  based information needed  to  support the  national  response
          against  HIV and AIDS epidemic. Research facilitates the identification and understanding the drivers        of
          HIV spread and maintain quality of response (interventions)

2.4.7.2   Situation Analysis
          The National  Policy   on HIV and     AIDS    has provisions for promoting  and supporting  multi-disciplinary
          operational research on HIV and AIDS, in order to produce information relevant for solving operational
          issues.

2.4.7.2.1 Achievements
               The existence of two national institutions namely, the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR)
               and the Tanzania Commission       for Science and Technology ( COSTECH) has facilitated coordination
               of research in the country.
               Existence of research agenda on HIV and AIDS /STIs for Health sector strategy on HIV and AIDS.
               Collaboration with local research institutions and implementing partners including Traditional Healers.
               Available local capacity to conduct research e.g National Institute for Medical Research, Muhimbili
               University  for Health and      Allied Sciences (MUHAS),    University of  Dar es  Salaam    (UDSM)    and
               Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) (formerly Ifakara Health Research and Development Centre (IHRDC)
               Several researches have been conducted and have influenced policy change.

2.4.7.2.2          Challenges

          Aspects                Challenges of Priority HIV and AIDS and STI research
          Availability              Limited capacity and resource   to conduct research  at the district level
                                    Limited research projects that address equity and gender dimensions in HIV and
                                    AIDS
                                    Inadequate dissemination of local   research findings, to policy makers ,
                                    programmes managers and the beneficiaries
                                    Limited research in the area of Paediatrics HIV and AIDS.
                                    Lack of fund within health sector to conduct operational research.
          Equitable access     Most funds provided by partners are committed to specific research areas determined
                                    by them and urban settings.

          Quality                   Weak research coordination within Health sector
                                    Poor communication between research coordinators and consumers of research
                                    findings.
                                    Limited research on quality issues regarding HIV and AIDS interventions.
                                    The mandate to clear research proposals reside in multiple institutions
                                 

2.4.7. 3   Emerging Issue
          o    Research priority agenda for HIV and AIDS is not well disseminated.
          o    Consequently, most researchers address research questions that are not of priority to the programme.

                                                                                                                     47
2.4.7.4   Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
             Most researches on HIV and AIDS in Tanzania are concentrated in Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro, Lake
             zone and   Mbeya regions. All studies have to respect equity in terms of urban and rural areas as well as
             gender considerations. Very little has been done to address the issue of gender disparities.

2.4.7.5   Strategic Objective
          To strengthen the health sector capacity to contribute to national HIV and AIDS and STI related research
          and development

2.4.8     Intervention Area 6: Documentation of Best Practices on HIV and AIDS in Tanzania

2.4.8.1   Preamble
         A Best Practice on HIV and AIDS is a body of knowledge about an aspect of HIV prevention, treatment or
         care that is based on practical experiences and lessons learned in a maturing field. A best practice should be
         replicable to improve the quality of an intervention that has as its objective the mitigation of one aspect of
         the HIV epidemic.
         The primary purpose of a Best Practice is to :
             document, understand and appreciate good and bad      experiences
             facilitate learning about what works and what doesnt
             share experiences
             assist the replication of successful interventions on a larger scale

2.4.8.2  Situation Analysis
         In Tanzania many practices that could qualify as best practice exist among the interventions that are being
         implemented by the government and its partners. . However, not much has been documented for sharing.

2.4.8.2.1 Challenges
          Aspects             Challenges in documentation of best practices
          Availability           Lack of national mechanism to track and document      best practices.
                                 Some best practice documents are available but not widely disseminated
          Equitable access       Tanzanians have   got   access to other best   practices .from other countries and
                                 very few from the country
                                 The existing documentation on best practices on Tanzania and     other countries is
                                 not equitably accessible to all Tanzanians. It is only accessible to those who
                                 access public libraries and internet services.
          Quality              Most of the  existing    documentation  focus    on  results and ignore  the process
                                 through which the experience emerged.

                                                                                                                     48
         Emerging issue
         o   Lack of skilled personnel to orient stakeholders in documentation of best practices
         o   Lack of skilled personnel to document best practices

         Equity, Gender and Sustainability Considerations
         o   Most of best practise documentation is done and used by foreigners
         o   There are no best practices documentation addressing gender disparities due to AIDS

2.4.8.3  Strategic Objective
         Ensure establishment of mechanisms to document best practices on HIV and AIDS
         Strategies
         1.  Ensure availability of  a framework to guide  documentation  and sharing of best practices on HIV and

IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK AND ITS OPERATIONALISATION

3.1.   Implementation Arrangements
       The Strategy defines the activities to be implemented at central level by the Ministry of Health and Social
       Welfare in all its structures with the oversight of the MOHSW through the NACP. It also provides guidance
       concerning the activities which need to be implemented at district and community levels through the District
       and Municipal Councils. The Non Governmental Organisations, Faith Based Organisations, private sector and
       civil society will participate in the implementation of the activities at both national and lower levels according
       to their capacities and comparative advantages.

       Each department of the MOHSW at central level will develop annual work plans in line with the fiscal year,
       for implementation, based on this strategy. These annual work plans will be funded through the budget within
       the MTEF. The Health Sector HIV and          AIDS Strategy has defined the interventions to be implemented at
       district level. The  implementation    of   these activities will  be under  the    Local  Government    Authorities
       Therefore, the District and Municipal Councils will have to incorporate the HIV and AIDS interventions into
       their comprehensive district plans based on the Strategic Plan for the health sector.

       The Council Health Management Teams (CHMTs) will be responsible for implementation, monitoring and
       evaluation  of  the district health sector based  HIV   and   AIDS   activities. In so doing,  they will involve  all
       relevant stakeholders at the district and community levels. The activities in the district plan will be part of the
       Comprehensive     Council    Health Plan   which  will be  budgeted  for funding    under  the MTEF   of  the Prime
       Ministers Office, Regional- Administration and Local Government and also supported through the activities
       of the Community Based Organizations ( CBOs).

       In order to operationalize the HIV and AIDS Health Sector Strategy, the MOHSW will work with regional
       health management teams and       all stakeholders to help the councils incorporate the interventions suggested in
       the Health Sector Plan.

       In addition to supporting the councils in planning, the MOHSW will continue to undertake quality assurance
       for the response at district level as well as advocate for the health sector HIV and AIDS responses to the
       districts. It will play this role through RHMTs, and CHMTs.

3.2.   Coordination Framework
       This strategic plan will be operationalised at three levels ­ the national, regional and district ­ in overlapping
       phases. This section describes the institutional arrangements, which are in place or those which need to be
       created at different levels in order to ensure efficient and effective implementation of the strategic plan.

3.2.1  National level
       At the national level it will be necessary to create the conditions for implementing the plan. Measures towards
       this end include:
           Strengthening     institutions responsible for HIV and AIDS response within the organizational structure of
           the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare.
           Conducting a      study to explore the appropriate functions and skills required for all levels of service
           delivery before a decision is made for it being either an agency of the MOHSW or a directorate
           Involving    the Presidents     Office Public Service   Management    (POPSM)      for approval and  posting  of
           additional staff with the requisite skills.
           Bringing the institutions to an optimum level in terms of the quality of its professional staff to enable it
           perform its role effectively;
           Orienting MOHSW leadership and officials as well as the heads of health institutions in the country
           towards integrating HIV and AIDS fully in their core business. This will involve issuing official circulars,
           retreats and meetings;
           Strengthening    further  the harmonization   of   the roles of NACP   and    TACAIDS      on one hand,   and of
           MOHSW and PMO RALG on the other hand.

3.2.2  Regional level
       Regional Authorities still retain a supervisory function over the performance of District Authorities on behalf
       of the Central Government. Measures should be taken to strengthen the capacity of RHMTs to enable them to
       provide effective supportive supervision in the districts.

                                                                                                                         50
3.2.3  District level
       At the district level the thrust will be towards strengthening the capacity of CHMTs/District Health Boards
       (DHBs),    working within the statutory committees of the Councils, Wards and Villages to plan, and integrate
       HIV   and  AIDS    interventions as part of their comprehensive      council health plans, and  ultimately in  their
       council development plans. This activity should be spearheaded jointly by the CHMTs and the Council AIDS
       Multisectoral Committees (CMACs), in collaboration with all the district heads of departments.        The RHMTs,
       CHMTs and Health Boards will be oriented in their roles in moving forward the HIV and AIDS agenda within
       the health sector.

       Terms of reference for the health sector District AIDS Control Coordinator (DACC) will be revised so that the
       position becomes the right hand person of the DMO and function more or less in the same specialised function
       as the NACP at the MOHSW. The HSHSP II is not intended to be an HIV and AIDS operational plan for
       districts, but interventions proposed are meant to constitute important inputs when districts formulate their
       plans. This plan and the strategies/ interventions do not remove the need for districts to review the HIV and
       AIDS situation and response in their areas and decide on the strategies/interventions which provide a good
       match.

       Advocacy to the districts in favour of this plan needs to be undertaken by the MOHSW through RHMTs.            This
       is in line with    the spirit of decentralization and    respect for districts autonomy    while  giving them   the
       information necessary to make informed choices.

3.2.4. Community level
       Many districts have a number of NGOs and CBOs who are active in the health aspects of HIV and AIDS. The
       MOHSW,      will   strengthen  the capacity of  district based   NGOs/CBOs     to deliver  quality and efficacious
       services  not  only by   providing  them   with guidelines  but   also by  providing  skills through  training and
       supportive supervision. This is a critical area for providing technical assistance in planning, implementing, as
       well as  monitoring and evaluation.

3.3.   Financing the Response

3.3.1. The cost of the health sector response to HIV and AIDS
       In Tanzania, a MKUKUTA based MDGs costing for the health sub-sector was done in 2006 by the Economic
       and Social Research Foundation (ESRF). Health Sector Costing was an attempt to estimate the cost, in terms
       of human   resources,   infrastructure and financial resources-to    meet the MDGs    as  well as the MKUKUTA
       targets by 2015 and 2010 respectively. The costing strongly acknowledged the fact that the health systems
       need strengthening in order to be able to respond to all health challenges.

       The unit costs used are attached as Annex 1. The Tables below show the estimates of two scenarios.

                                                                                                                      51

3.3.2. Resource Management
       There is a continued emphasis on mobilising financial resources into 2008 -2012 within the framework of
       HSHSP II, at national and international levels in anticipation of achieving the scale up of activities needed to
       control the crisis of HIV and     AIDS.   However, as more resources      are   made available  nationally, the capacity to
       allocate to prioritised and cost effective interventions, and to disburse funds to the providers and communities,
       who implement these actions are also critically important.            In the strategic management of resources for the
       Health Sector Response, it is imperative that all three aspects of resource management be considered that is
       mobilisation, allocation and disbursement.

3.3.2.1 Resource Mobilisation
       To achieve effective resource management, sources and flows of financial resources need to be estimated so as
       to  indicate    broadly   to the Implementing     Partners   (IP)  who  complete     more   detailed  operational  plans    the
       resource envelope in which they should plan.

       The most likely trends on financial resources available for implementing the NMSF for the next five years
       have been estimated. Three possible scenarios were considered. The analysis was based on existing trends
       (using actual disbursement rather than planned or budgeted levels). Development partners accounted for close
       to 90% of total public expenditure on HIV and AIDS in 2005/6.

Since under any scenario financial resources are likely to be tight, prudent allocation of resources between the four
thematic areas is of critical importance to achieve the highest impact for every shilling spent on HIV and AIDS
interventions.

3.3.2.2Resource Allocation
        It is often shown that it is not only lack of funding that constrains implementation, but rather uncertainty and
       delayed flows of funds.

a) Overall Trends in HIV and AIDS Expenditure
Total  expenditure     (including   donors    off-budget  spending)  was     equivalent  to   7.5%  of total  Government    budget
spending in 2005/6 and about 14% of total Government revenue. The Budget for 2006/07 shows slight decrease

Given the fact that in previous years, the MOHSW and TACAIDS account for over 95% of budgeted and 97% of
actual spending in 2005/06, then the Health sector relies heavily on Development partners funding. This implies,
among   other    things, the    need   to carry    out  sustainability  analysis,   particularly   on   funding    related   to recurrent
expenditure supported by external financing.

The Table 15 below shows the expenditure in the health sector. The analysis shows that about 56% of the funds were
used  for multi-purpose   activities    related to HIV/AIDS,      35%  went   specifically  for  care and  treatment,  8%   for
prevention and 1% for mitigation.

In another study by Tax and Phillip (2004) that specifically analysed Development Partners spending, about 38%
was spent on multipurpose activities, 25% on care and support, 16% on cross-cutting issues, 14% on preventive
interventions, 5% on unclassified activities and 2% on impact mitigation.           In yet another study related to HIV AND
AIDS funding by Deloitte (2006), about 64% of the funding went for care and support, 14% for prevention, 8% each
for  cross-cutting issues and multi-purpose        interventions, 4%   for   policy and  administration  and   2%  for impact
mitigation.

The  Deloitte study   (2006)  observes      that   resources are   increasing  being    directed towards   care   and  support
interventions in recent years. The increase is due to a recent emphasis on treatment, including the introduction of
ARVs.

The financial needs can also be analysed from the overal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare MTEF and 2006/07
budget which includes the budget for the HIV and AIDS component shown in number 5 in the table below:

The above table shows the total budget for the MOHSW according to the MTEF for the period indicated (2005/06 and
2006/07). From the table the allocaction for the HIV and AIDS component is about 19 million USD                  (exchange rate
1250/= for 1USD) with a gap of about 33 million USD for the total of 52 million required in 2006/2007. The overall
budget for the MOHSW in 2006/2007 has deficit of about 15% and this has a serious bearing on all the departments
and programmes of the Ministry including HIVand AIDS.

Given the findings discussed above the suggested allocation of the resources for the health sector response to HIV and
AIDS is as shown in Table 17 below:

3.3.2.3. Resource Disbursement and Tracking of Funds
       Ensuring the timely and efficient transfer and disbursement of funds to implementing partners is also a key
       element of the management of funds.       Given  the  complexity  of     HIV   and  AIDS funding   due  to the multi-
       sectoral nature of the response, the systems for resource disbursement and fund tracking are expected to be as
       equally complex.    However, much work is ongoing to harmonise and align international funding sources as
       well as to strengthen public and civil society capacities for resource management for HIV and AIDS.               The
       strategy to mainstream or integrate HIV and AIDS action into operational plans and budgets will actively
       facilitate the harmonisation agenda.

3.3.5. Sustainability
       The  government    of Tanzania   is  committed   to fighting  HIV   and    AIDS.   The strengthening    of the linked
       components - from facility   to the community is intended to ensure that the health system regains its capacity
       to regenerate and maintain its workforce. The government is committed to work and support the private sector
       in its initiative of public/private/partnership to ensure the services are sustainable. The inclusion of Private
       sector, NGOs, CBOS and FBOs ensures consistency and joint commitment to the process.             Support from other
       partners will continue to be sought to complement the government efforts.
       The  HSHSP     II   will be operating    within the  existing  government      health  infrastructure. This  provides
       administration and management of the plan in an integrated manner.

3.3.5.1. Management System
       The coordination structure and management system put in place by the government will be used as an entry
       point to scale up and sustain the activities in this plan. The MOHSW through            the NACP will oversee the
       implementation of the Strategy.

3.3.5.2. Community Participation and Involvement
       Community    mobilization   efforts,  which will enhance   the  achievement      of community    ,,ownership   of the
       strategy will be supported. This includes the encouragement of wide participation of community members
       particularly traditional and   vulnerable   groups   who   may  not      have  a voice such   as women,    children .
       Partnerships with   different sectors both public and private, PLHIV and Civil Society Organizations (Faith
       Based Organizations and Community Based Organizations) will be strengthened to institutionalize the use of
       the  participatory learning and  action  methodology    which  will aim     to involve community    members    in the
       implementation of the strategy. One of the strategies is to ensure community ownership of the HIV and AIDS
       responses that entails that the community continue to give care and support to HIV and AIDS issues even
       when there is no external support.

3.3.5.3. Financial Sustainability

       National Level
       The government of Tanzania is committed to long-term funding to support the implementation of the Health
       Sector Strategy for HIV and AIDS 2008-2012. It is envisioned      that the Governments financial contribution to
       HIV and AIDS activities will   increase by 74% from TZS 35 billion in 2005/06 to TZS 61.0 billion in 2007/08
       and to a further 75% to TZS 82 billion by 2012.       The Development Partners are expected to maintain their
       level of financial support of the last years or to slightly scale it up.

       District and Community Level
       Through   Community    Funds,  communities   will   learn how  to mobilize     resources within  their  communities.
       Moreover, the awareness created through small scale or village mobilization campaigns to leverage money for
       the Community Fund will create an awareness of the problems due to HIV and AIDS.               Communities that are
       more aware of the problems that confront them due to HIV and AIDS are more likely to devote resources.
       Communities will be empowered through skills and confidence in handling funds to access resources from
       other sources.

       The existence of mechanism that directly deposits funds to the village accounts instead of the district accounts
       will help in  inculcating  the spirit of responsibility   and accountability.    The  village financial management
       training package developed by Department of Social Welfare is in place, hence the CMAC and VMAC in the
       districts will be trained on such key issues as keeping records, fundraising and financial management.

3.4.   Monitoring and Evaluation of the Plan

3.4.1  Objectives
       The objective of the M&E mechanism for HSHSP 2008-2012 are the following:
       1.To generate  information for the  management to    assess the progress of implementation of HSHSP 2008-2012
       2.To make recommendations on strategies to improve designs and future performance

                                                                                                                         55
   3.4.2. Monitoring and Evaluation Components
       Monitoring   and  evaluation  of  the   implementation   of the HSHSP     2008-2012    will be  conducted   through
       appropriate existing and new systems, procedures and mechanisms.         The National Monitoring and Evaluation
       Sub-Committee will be responsible for providing advice on all matters concerning monitoring and evaluation.

       A list of the basic minimum indicators for the planning period is designed and the indicators are classified
       according to the strategic objectives.

       HSHSP Indicators
       The   indicators to be used   in monitoring    and evaluating   this HSHSP   cover  4   major   themes: Prevention,
       Treatment,   care and  support,  Cross-cutting   and Health   System     Strengthening. The   goals/objectives and
       indicators were guided by the following sources:
             Millennium Development Goals and indicators;
             Indicators covered in the previous Health Sector Strategic Plans (HSSPs) that are still deemed relevant;
             Goals, indicators   and   targets of national  programmes      and  international declarations/commitments
             (UNGASS, MKUKUTA, Abuja Declaration, etc); and
             Other emerging high priority areas for the health sector in Tanzania.
       MOHSW and the CPs will harmonise sector performance indicators and use these as the basis for the joint
       reviews. Indicators  will include:  output  and  process indicators   to assess service  delivery (quality, access,
       efficiency)  and  indicators of  health status (impact). They   will  be derived as far  as  possible from  routine
       monitoring systems (HMIS) and build on those required for the monitoring and evaluation of the MKUKUTA,
       NMSF and the MTEF in order to avoid duplication of effort.

       Monitoring
       Depending on the type and relevance of the indicators, routine monitoring will be undertaken, on a monthly,
       quarterly, bi-annual and annual basis. The HMIS, and other routine systems will be the major tools for data
       collection. The TACAIDS, MoHSW, implementing partners            and other agencies will primarily use this data
       and its analyses for decision making.

       MoHSW     will   produce  quarterly   activity and  financial reports  for all  levels  of  the health  system  for
       consideration at the Joint Review meetings.     It will also produce an Annual Performance Review Report, on
       the performance of the sector against annual plans and output targets.

       MoHSW will be responsible for sector performance monitoring and review.            It will plan and lead the Joint
       Annual Reviews (JAR), together with appropriate involvement and support of development partner P, other
       Government ministries and other key stakeholders.

       Development partners and other key stakeholders will actively and fully participate in the JAR and will accept
       the JAR as satisfying their own review requirements. To the extent possible, they will not undertake separate
       monitoring or review missions, without the approval of the National M&E Sub Committee.

       Evaluation
       There will be two evaluations over    the duration of this plan. These will consist of a mid-term assessment after
       the first three years of implementation and a comprehensive summative           evaluation in 2012. MOHSW will
       organise a joint mid-term review (MTR) before the end of the third year of HSHSP II. An independent external
       evaluation will be undertaken in the final year of HSHSP II . All stakeholders will agree on the timing, terms
       of reference and composition of these two review missions. All costs will be included in the Health Sector
       Budget. Where appropriate, the MTR and the final HSHSP evaluations will be combined with the JAR for that
       year.

       The mid-term assessment will focus on progress made in plan implementation and assess the appropriateness
       of the overall strategic direction. It will therefore be designed to inform the remaining period of the plan and
       recommend adjustments where needed.

       The summative     evaluation will focus on outcome/impact of the HSHSP and assist in providing the contextual
       framework for the subsequent planning period.

3.4.3. M&E Implementation roles and responsibilities
       The implementation of the overall Monitoring and Evaluation functions regarding the HSHSP 2008-2012 will
       be done under the management and supervision of Directorate of Preventive Services in the MOHSW through
       the Manager of NACP. However participation and involvement of other stakeholders from both public and
       private sectors will be encouraged in the process.

                                                                                                                      56
  The Monitoring and Evaluation functions will be implemented at three levels namely, the national, regional
  and district levels. At national level, NACP will be directly responsible, while at the regional and district
  levels, the RHMT and CHMT respectively will be responsible.

3.4.2 Documentation of Lessons Learned
  In the monitoring and evaluation process, best practices will be identified and strategies will be developed to
  improve weaknesses. The identified best   practice will be documented and shared with other stakeholders to
  improve practices across the sector.

                                                                                                               57
