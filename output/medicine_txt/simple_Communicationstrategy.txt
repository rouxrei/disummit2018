      this period, the health sector has played a very critical role, in creating public awareness on HIV and AIDS, as well
      as, in providing services for prevention, care, treatment and support.

      The health sector has made extensive engagement with various players, in the HIV and AIDS response, since the
      beginning of the epidemic, in the early 1980's. Many of the players were involved in the information, education, and

      Mkapa, in 1999, called upon all Tanzanians, to intensify their efforts in prevention and control of the epidemic. The
      establishment of the Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS), in 2000, institutionalized a national framework,
      for the coordination of the national multisectoral response, against HIV and AIDS.

      During the past twenty years, the number of communicators has been growing very fast focusing mainly on health
      sector related HIV and AIDS interventions. The health sector interventions, include Blood safety, STI management,
      HIV counseling and testing, ART access, PMTCT and Male circumcision. Most of these interventions, require pro
      curement of equipment, supplies, drugs and other commodities, and have to be provided by trained health personnel.
      The promotion of these services, through various communication activities, requires an existence of a functional
      health care system , including a competent workforce. In view of this, the health sector has seen the need, to stream
      line communication activities, that promote the existing services, in order to improve the accountability of players.

      Based on the results of the HIV and AIDS Communication situation analysis, that was conducted in eight regions,
      (Arusha, DaresSalaam, Dodoma, Iringa, Kigoma, Mara, Mtwara and Shinyanga), the Ministry of Health and So

      The Health Sector HIV and AIDS Communication Strategy, will be the blueprint for communication on prevention,
      care and treatment services, for the period 2008 to 2015. It is expected to improve, promote and strengthen the com
      munication activities, among different players and stakeholders who are involved in the national response to HIV
      and AIDS, within the health sector.
      It is our hope that, all players will utilize this strategy, in planning, implementing and evaluating HIV and AIDS
      Communication interventions, in Tanzania.

gies, audience, channels, messages and activities are described in details throughout the document.

Purpose of Communication Strategy:
The Health Sector Communication strategy on HIV and AIDS provides a guide, ideas and directions to the IEC/
BCC interventions at national, regional and district levels, in addressing key issues which hinder utilization of ex
isting HIV and AIDS services. This document is also meant to be userfriendly and provide a simple framework for
guiding communication activities among     players.

Guiding principles:
In order to be more focused it was necessary to set a few guiding principles for effective implementation of activi
ties. The following are the principles:

1.     Evidence Based
       Evidence based information and data form the foundation for the communication strategy as this will direct

      1.1 The need for a Communication Strategy to support the Health Sector HIV and AIDS
      interventions
      The HIV and AIDS awareness/knowledge level has risen from below 5.7% in the early 1980s, to over 90% in
      recent years in the adult population (DHS 2004). These apparent achievements are as a result of a number of
      communication interventions (popularly referred to as IEC activities) which have been implemented throughout

      the reduction of the HIV prevalence rates over time. The government's desire is to reduce the prevalence rates
      to decimal levels. This can only be achieved through concerted efforts by all players through the Multisectoral
      response and especially through effective communication strategies by all actors.

      The Tanzanian community      is currently accessing HIV  and AIDS     information  from many  different sources.
      Occasionally some of this information demand extra services to be provided or implemented by the health sector.
      The services demanded, often require the government to increase its own service inputs through procurement of
      supplies and commodities and putting in place appropriate mechanisms for delivering the additional services which

      promoted but not provided by the same organizations or institutions.

      It is from this understanding that the need to develop a National Communication Strategy for HIV and AIDS in the
      Health Sector 2008 ­ 2015 in Tanzania Mainland was envisaged.
      In preparation for the development for the strategy the need for understanding what is on the ground in regard
      to HIV and AIDS information and communication was assessed through a situation analysis study. The overall
      goal was to establish a comprehensive picture of the current communication practice, ranging from production of
      communication messages and materials to direct communication with audiences using such materials and others
      within the health sector.

      It is this information which was used in the development of the Health Sector HIV and AIDS Communication
      Strategy to support implementation of the Health Sector HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (HSHSP II) 2008 ­ 2012.

      It involved in depth interviews with individuals who provide HIV and AIDS education and personal health services,
      as well as representatives of organizations involved in HIV and AIDS control activities. The interviews sought to
      elicit information about their HIV and AIDS communication practice with individuals and collectives.    In depth

      communication interventions. These included patients seen at HIV and AIDS Care and Treatment Clinics, Politicians
      and Administrators at the district, and local levels, including Religious Leaders. The thrust of the interviews was
      to obtain some information about what people in their communities made of the HIV and AIDS messages and
      materials reaching them.

     1.5.3 Awareness of the presence of HIV and AIDS educators who do not practice what they teach/say
     Most of the key informants were aware that some of the Educators of the HIV and AIDS did not practice what they
     said, and this was of concern to them.

     1.6 The role of social structural and vulnerability factors
     New infections appear to occur among young girls. Studies of sexual behaviour among adolescent girls show that
     even girls from well to do families do engage in sexual activities that expose them to the risk of HIV infection. For
     them poverty may not be the underlying factor. They have other needs, including satisfying sexual desire. Girls from
     wealthy families may desire things which are much more of sentimental/symbolic value rather than material value.

     Many informants did not recognize the role of social structural and vulnerability factors associated with the HIV
     infections of young girls, they simply blamed the girls who get infected for their sexual behaviour.

     This is also true about married women who get infected with HIV. These women were blamed for being unfaithful.
     This has resonance in the context of discordance where between 30 and 40 per cent of the infected couples are

3                 THE HEALTH SECTOR HIV& AIDS COMMUNICATION STRATEGY 2008-2015
couples where the female partner is the infected one. The question is why should they be unfaithful?

The common perception has been that unfaithful males are the main link between high risk groups and the general

The informants blamed the reluctance of some people to access counseling and testing services on cumbersome
testing procedures. They were reluctant to have to go through counseling, and asked to be tested without counseling,
alleging that for pretest

BOX 2: CONFRONTING THE SEXUAL MODE OF HIV TRANSMISSION

Since the sexual mode of HIV transmission accounts for most of the HIV infection in this country the pro-
posed communication strategy must address this factor head on, and the HIV prevention messages must
be about it. Despite the epidemiological diversity of the epidemic the bottom line is that people in different
social situations get infected as a result of exposure due to engaging in unprotected sex ­ penile vaginal
and penile anal, whether between men or between men and women.              This fatal sex could be with sex
workers, it could be sex between older men and younger girls, sex with own spouses and regular sexual
partners, and the phenomenon of discordance of sero-status between couples attests to this.

People engage in concurrent multiple partner sexual relationships for many reasons but the desire for
heightened excitement and sexual pleasure are paramount. This motivation for sexual pleasure needs to
be acknowledged, and people should be given the skills for making sexual relations in monogamous and
faithful relationships highly pleasurable instead of being boring.

Preference for unprotected sex is often driven by the desire for deeper sexual satisfaction. Condoms and
other forms of safer sex need to be eroticized, and should not be promoted simply because of their protec-

So far HIV and AIDS communication in Tanzania has been largely fettered by considerations of cultural
sensitivity. This communication strategy should lead to breaking the mold. Tanzanians should not be left
to succumb to infection simply because AIDS educators -both formal and informal- have to censor them-
selves lest they offend cultural norms of not talking about sex explicitly.
We should not be resigned to believing that we cannot change people's sexual behavior, and hence em-
bark on HIV prevention measures which do not require change in sexual behavior, such as treating STIs
which are a co-factor for HIV infection, getting men circumcised in order to reduce the chances of getting
infected during sexual intercourse with an infected partner, and preventing an infected mother from in-
fecting her child by offering PMTCT services, instead of trying to prevent her from getting infected in the

and demand to be given PEP afterwards! Unfortunately the model of emergency contraception does not
apply. PEP given to prevent infection due to non-occupational exposure has been found to have serious
side effects, including diabetes and liver damage.

     3.4 Theme 4: Challenges posed by legal and other constraints to serving and communicating with
     children and adolescents.

      Preamble:
               ­  Some health service providers claim they are not trained to provide VCT and ART services to children
                  and adolescents who are legal minors.

               ­  Children and adolescents not targeted with appropriate messages crafted and packaged to appeal to
                  them to facilitate formation of preventive behaviour and behaviour change

     3.4.1     Strategic objective 4.1: Awareness created for HIV and AIDS communicators for effective
               communication with children and adolescents, and for health workers for providing counseling, testing and
               ART services to them.

     3.4.1.1 Messages:
           \   Break the culture of silence, talk to children and adolescents about HIV and AIDS.
           \   It is not right for children living with HIV to be on ART and not be told about their HIV status, especially
               when they don't feel that there is something wrong with them.
           \   Give correct and complete information about HIV and AIDS to children and adolescents, especially those
               who are infected.
           \   Children should not assume that their mothers who infected them, or their parents who succumbed to HIV
               and AIDS must have been infected through sexual promiscuity, and have to be embarrassed about it.
           \   Encourage children to report any undue attention, including inappropriate touching, and words of endearment
               from older people such behaviour could be the precursors of child sexual abuse, and subsequent exposure
               to HIV infection.

       words/speech and stigmatizing behaviour towards PLHIV, and about HIV and AIDS.

   \   If you know the basic facts about HIV and AIDS you will not be afraid of the information the you got
       infected through casual contacts with an infected person.
   \   PLHIV did not necessarily get infected by engaging in immoral behaviour or improper sex.
   \   Gossip, name calling and voyeurism make PLHIV face social isolation from family, friends and the
       community. Desist from such behaviour.
   \   Your words and actions may be stigmatizing.
   \   Getting infected is not necessarily the responsibility of PLHIV, the sexual encounter may have been with a
       spouse, it might have been coerced, and some may have been raped.

   \    Women and men cite dissatisfaction with their primary partnerships, sexually and otherwise
   \    Dissatisfaction is attributed to lack of communication and romance.
   \    Confounders include partner's lack of skills in love making, monotony, domestic discord, and desire for
        variety in partnerships, and sexual practices.
   \    The economic factor for women is important though not paramount.

6.1 Introduction
Implementation framework is a pre requisite for the effective implementation of a strategic plan since it spells out
clearly the roles and responsibilities of persons/institutions during the period of execution.

Good governance is also a key element for successful implementation of planned activities at all levels. Good
Governance which simply means the process of decision making and the process by which decisions are being
implemented (or not implemented) is essential in the implementation of any Strategic plan.

Participation of men and women that include disabled people is a key cornerstone of good governance. Participation
could be either direct or through legitimate intermediate institutions or representatives.

Accountability is another key requirement of good governance not only in the governmental institutions but also in
the Nongovernmental institutions as well as the Private sector and the Civil Society Organizations
